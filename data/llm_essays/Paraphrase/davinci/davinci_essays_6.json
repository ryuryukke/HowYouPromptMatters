    "The Electoral College system is being opposed by some people because it does not permit the presidential candidates to focus their attention on the majority of the voters. It is a system, where the candidate with the highest number of votes in a state wins a certain number of electoral votes, which is proportional to the population of the state. The candidate who wins more than half of the electoral votes is elected as the president. It is quite possible that the candidate who wins the most popular votes may not win the election. As an example, if a candidate wins 52% of the popular votes, and the other candidate wins 48%, the candidate with less popular votes wins the election. This is because the Electoral College system gives all the electoral votes to the candidates based on the number of votes won in the states. The candidates do not focus on the voters in the states where they do not have much chance of winning. This is one of the reasons for which the Electoral College system is opposed by some people.\n\nThe Electoral College system is being opposed by some people because it prevents the voters from directly electing the President and Vice President of the United States.

    "Since the founding of the United States, the Electoral College system has been used to elect the U.S. President. The system was designed to ensure the election of a president by a qualified electorate. In the Electoral College system, the voters do not vote directly for the president, but instead, vote for electors who are pledged to vote for a specific candidate. The number of electors for each state is equal to the number of members of the U.S. House of Representatives and senators from that state. The electors cast their votes based on the result of the popular vote in their state. The candidate who receives a majority of electors wins the election. The Electoral College system has several advantages. For example, it is less expensive and more efficient than a national popular vote. The Electoral College system also ensures the election of a president by a qualified electorate. In addition, it provides the most direct link between the people and their elected representatives. However, the Electoral College system has some disadvantages. For example, the system is vulnerable to the influence of money and media. In addition, the system is prone to error. The vote counting process is complex and error-prone. The Electoral College system could be improved by replacing it with a national popular vote. The national popular vote would guarantee the election of a president by the people. However, it would be more expensive and less efficient than the Electoral College system. It would also be more vulnerable to the influence of money and media. Therefore, the Electoral College system is the best option for electing the U.S. President. \n\nThank you very much for your time and consideration!\n\nBest regards,\nNikolay\n",

    "Distracted driving is the number one cause of accidents in the US. In this essay I will explain the unintended consequences of the popularity of mobile devices, specifically in relation to distracted driving. I will use statistics and examples to support my argument and discuss the severity of the issue. Additionally, I will explore the various forms of distracted driving and the laws and regulations in place to prevent it.\n\nThe most common cause of distracted driving in the US is the use of mobile devices. In 2018 nearly 3,000 people were killed and 400,000 were injured in accidents involving a distracted driver. This is an increase of nearly 10% over the previous year (National Safety Council). The use of mobile devices by drivers is the leading cause of distracted driving, with nearly 2/3 of drivers reporting that they have used their devices while driving. In addition to the safety risks of distracted driving, it also carries a steep price tag. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the cost of accidents that involve a distracted driver is over $50 billion per year.\n\nThere are a number of different forms of distracted driving, including but not limited to the use of mobile devices, eating, and grooming. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, nearly 20% of all accidents in the US are due to distracted driving. This number has increased significantly over the past few years, with an estimated 4,500 people killed and 400,000 injured in 2018 alone. Furthermore, research shows that distracted drivers are more likely to be involved in an accident than non-distracted drivers. The risk of an accident increases by 23% when using a mobile device while driving (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). The most common form of distracted driving is texting, with 69% of drivers admitting to doing so. In addition to texting, drivers also use their devices to make calls, check social media, and use navigation apps. While all forms of distracted driving are dangerous, texting while driving is the most dangerous, with a risk of accident that is 23 times higher than non-distracted driving. The risk of an accident is 6 times higher when eating or drinking, and 4 times higher when grooming (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration).\n\nIn order to prevent distracted driving, many states have implemented laws that ban texting while driving. While these laws are in place, they are mostly unenforced due to the difficulty of detecting distracted drivers. As a result, distracted driving continues to pose a significant threat to the safety of drivers and passengers. In addition to the laws in place to prevent distracted driving, many states have also implemented laws that ban the use of mobile devices while driving. These laws are designed to reduce the number of distracted drivers on the road, but they do not address the",
    "The use of mobile devices while driving is a major cause of accidents and fatalities in the modern world. This is mainly because people tend to be distracted while using these devices, which makes them take their eyes off the road and ignore other vehicles in front of them. The situation is further worsened due to the fact that these devices have become a necessity in the modern world, which makes it difficult to avoid using them. However, there are several steps that can be taken to avoid the use of these devices while driving.\n\nOne of the most effective ways of avoiding the use of mobile devices while driving is by creating awareness among the public. This is because most people are unaware of the dangers of using mobile devices while driving. For instance, many people do not know that they can be fined or even imprisoned for using these devices while driving. As a result, they continue to use these devices while driving, which increases the chances of accidents. This can be done by educating people about the dangers of using these devices while driving and offering them alternatives to using these devices while driving.\n\nAnother way of avoiding the use of mobile devices while driving is by creating laws that prohibit the use of these devices while driving. This can be done by creating laws that prohibit the use of these devices while driving. For instance, many countries have laws that prohibit the use of these devices while driving. However, these laws are often not enforced as they are not strictly enforced.\n\nFinally, another way of avoiding the use of mobile devices while driving is by creating laws that require drivers to wear seat belts while driving. This is because seat belts are one of the most effective ways of avoiding accidents. As a result, many countries have created laws that require drivers to wear seat belts while driving.\n\nAs a result, the use of mobile devices while driving is a major cause of accidents and fatalities in the modern world. However, there are several ways of avoiding the use of these devices while driving.\n\n(344 words)\n\nShare this post on:\n\nRelated posts: IELTS Writing Task 2 Sample 1473 \u2013 Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using mobile phones IELTS Writing Task 2 Sample 1474 \u2013 Should mobile phones and laptops be banned in schools?

    "Littering is a major cause of uncleanliness in the school premises. If this problem is not addressed immediately, it may cause many health issues, and the students may also start developing a sense of irresponsibility and disrespect. Thus, I propose the following solution:\n\nThe school should implement a new rule wherein the students will be charged a fine of 50 rupees for littering. This fine can be used to fund the cleanup activities of the school. The parents will be informed about this rule, and they will be responsible for paying the fine to the school. Thus, the parents can teach their children to be responsible and keep the school premises clean.\n\nAfter a few months, the school can also reward students who do not litter. This will motivate the students to be responsible and keep the school clean.\n\nBy implementing this solution, not only will the students develop a sense of responsibility and accountability, but they will also learn to be more disciplined. This will help to create a better environment for learning in the school.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nY",

    "It is a common belief that students are better off if they are given their own summer projects rather than being assigned to do their homework by their teachers. I believe that this is a false assumption. Students can benefit from both ways.\n\nOn the one hand, students may have to work on their own projects they are interested in, such as finding a new job for a summer camp, arranging a birthday party, or finding a new place to go on holiday. They will be able to focus more on these projects, and they will be able to learn things that they are interested in. This will make them more productive and will keep them motivated.\n\nOn the other hand, students may spend more time on their summer projects than on their assigned homework, and they may not be able to finish their projects on time. This will result in a lot of stress, which can lead to depression. In addition, students may not be able to focus on their summer projects, because they do not know anything about the subject matter, and they will not be able to finish their projects on time.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that both ways are beneficial for students. Students will be able to learn things that they are interested in, and they will be able to learn something new. In addition, students will be able to learn something new, and they will be able to learn something new.\nReport \n\nPost Comment\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank you for your time and effort.

    "The thesis statement for this essay is that seeking multiple perspectives when researching and writing an article is of utmost importance as it helps to eliminate bias and strengthen arguments. This is an academic essay and the purpose is to explain and convince the reader that seeking multiple perspectives when researching and writing an article is of utmost importance. The essay will be divided into three sections. The first section will explain the importance of seeking multiple perspectives. The second section will illustrate how different individuals may have varying levels of knowledge and expertise on a given topic. The third section will explain how seeking out multiple sources can help to ensure accuracy and depth in one's work.\n\nThe first section will explain the importance of seeking multiple perspectives. To begin with, one of the most important reasons for seeking multiple perspectives is that it helps to eliminate bias and strengthen arguments. For example, if there is a research paper on a given topic and the author is biased towards a particular point of view then the reader will not believe the arguments. So, if the author seeks multiple perspectives about the topic then it will help to eliminate bias and strengthen the arguments. Another reason is that it helps to ensure accuracy and depth in one's work. For example, if an author is writing about a given topic and he/she is looking only at one perspective then it is possible that he/she is missing out on some important information. So, if the author seeks multiple perspectives on the topic then it will help to ensure accuracy and depth in one's work.\n\nThe second section will illustrate how different individuals may have varying levels of knowledge and expertise on a given topic. For example, if an author is writing about a given topic then he/she may not have the necessary knowledge and expertise on that topic. So, if the author seeks multiple perspectives on the topic then it will help to ensure accuracy and depth in one's work. Another example is that if a person is writing about a given topic and he/she is looking only at one perspective then it is possible that he/she is missing out on some important information. So, if the author seeks multiple perspectives on the topic then it will help to ensure accuracy and depth in one's work.\n\nThe third section will explain how seeking out multiple sources can help to ensure accuracy and depth in one's work.

    "The method of electing the president of the United States has been a topic of discussion for a long time. With the 2016 presidential election, the question of which method is better has once again come to the forefront. There are two ways to elect the president of the United States, the Electoral College and the popular vote. The Electoral College is a body of electors chosen by voters to elect the president and vice president of the United States. The popular vote is a vote in which all eligible voters can vote for the president and vice president. The popular vote is usually more popular than the Electoral College in the United States. However, the Electoral College method has its advantages. The Electoral College method ensures that the president is elected by the people of the United States, but also by the most influential states in the country. With the popular vote, the president is elected only by the people of the United States. The Electoral College is a compromise between the popular vote and the Senate. The Senate represents the states, and the popular vote represents the people of the United States. The Electoral College is a compromise that makes the president elected by the people of the United States and the states. The Electoral College method has been used since 1787, and has been used for 230",
    "It is commonly said that opinions are like noses, everyone has one. However, sometimes we can be so entrenched in our own opinions that we fail to see other points of view. When it comes to making a decision, it is important to seek advice from a range of sources. Decisions that are made with a range of opinions in mind are often better and more informed. Seeking advice can lead to a better choice, as well as learning opportunities.\n\nThere are many situations where a decision has to be made. For example, a new job may require moving to another country. If the decision is made without taking into account the opinions of friends and family, it may be very difficult for the individual to adapt to the different culture. However, if the person listens to the views of others, they may be able to make a more informed decision.\n\nIn addition, seeking advice can lead to learning opportunities. For example, if a woman is contemplating having a baby, she may ask her doctor for advice. The doctor may then suggest that she has a test to ensure that she is healthy enough to have a child. If the woman had not sought advice, she may have had the baby and then later discovered that she was not healthy enough to have children. This could lead to further problems for the woman and her child.\n\nIn conclusion, seeking advice is very important when making a decision. This is because it helps people to make better choices and learn from their experiences.\n",
    "Community service is a voluntary activity that is undertaken by students in order to benefit the society. It is not a compulsory activity and students are free to decide whether or not they want to be a part of it. The participation in community service has both advantages and disadvantages. This essay will discuss both the aspects of the community service.\n\nThe main advantage of community service is that it helps the students to develop a sense of responsibility. The students learn to take responsibility of their actions and understand that their actions have consequences. They also learn to appreciate the efforts of others. The students learn to work as a team and develop leadership skills. The participation in community service also helps them to develop social skills and helps them to interact with a variety of people. The students learn to solve problems and to think critically. These skills are vital for the personal growth of the students. The participation in community service also helps the students to develop a sense of social belonging. The students learn to empathize with others and they learn to respect the diversity of the society.\n\nThe main disadvantage of community service is that it can distract the students from their studies. The students get distracted by the social activities and they do not focus on their studies. The participation in community service is time consuming and the students do not get enough time to devote to their studies. The participation in community service can also affect the physical health of the students. The students do not get time to exercise and they become physically inactive. The participation in community service can also affect the social life of the students. The students do not get time to interact with their friends and they become socially isolated.\n\nTo conclude, the participation in community service has both advantages and disadvantages. The students should be made to participate in community service so that they can develop a sense of responsibility and learn to interact with others. However, the students should be given enough time to devote to their studies and they should not be forced to participate in community service.\n\nTotal Words: 333\n\nGrammar: 9/10\n\nVocabulary: 9/10\n\nUse of language: 9/10\n\nOverall",

    "The trend of cities implementing car-free zones or car-free days is becoming more and more popular around the world. This is because it has a positive impact on the environment and on the quality of life for residents. In this essay I will discuss this trend by using examples from Vauban, Paris, Beijing, and Bogota.\n\nFirst of all, it can be said that people in car-free zones are healthier. This is because they are forced to walk and cycle instead of driving. This is also good for the environment because it reduces the amount of pollution. It is true that it is a bit more time consuming, but it is a small price to pay for a better environment. For example, in Vauban, a city in Germany, there are no cars. Instead, people have to walk, ride their bikes, or use public transport. This means that the city's air quality is much better than in other cities, and people are generally healthier. This is also the case in Paris, where cars are banned on a certain day every week. This is also the case in Bogota, a city in Colombia. Here, a car-free day is held every Sunday. People are encouraged to take public transport, or to walk or cycle, instead of driving. This is also good for the quality of life, because people often do not have to wait for a bus or a metro when they arrive at the station. This is also the case in Beijing, a city in China. There, a car-free day is held once a week. This is also the case in Paris, where a car-free day is held once a week.\n\nIn conclusion, it can be said that people in car-free zones are healthier and are forced to walk and cycle instead of driving. This is also good for the environment because it reduces the amount of pollution. It is true that it is a bit more time consuming, but it is a small price to pay for a better environment.\n\n(",

    "As a student, I think distance learning can be a good and bad thing. The good thing about distance learning is that it can be very flexible for students as they can choose when and where to study. The bad thing about distance learning is that students may feel lonely, isolated and distracted. I personally think distance learning is good for students who are working and who are single parents because they can study in their own time and at their own pace. However, I think there are lots of disadvantages for distance learning, which include distractions at home, electronic complications, and the potential for limited social skills development.\n\nFirstly, distractions at home can be the biggest problem for distance learning students. According to a study conducted by the University of Phoenix, distractions at home are the biggest concern for distance learning students. The study found that students are distracted by their children, television, noise, and other household activities. In addition, students may feel lonely and isolated. They may feel isolated because they don\u2019t get to experience the social side of a college campus. Secondly, electronic complications are a big problem for distance learning students. For example, students may have difficulty connecting to the Internet or they may not have the necessary software to complete assignments. Lastly, distance learning students may experience limited social skills development. According to a study conducted by the University of Phoenix, students who take distance learning classes are less likely to interact with their peers than those who take traditional classes. In addition, students who take distance learning classes have a higher risk of dropping out of college than students who take traditional classes.\n\nI think distance learning is good for students who are working and who are single parents because they can study in their own time and at their own pace.

    "For many people, the automobile has become an indispensable part of their daily lives. In the future, however, driverless cars may become a common sight on the streets of major cities around the world. In this essay, I will discuss the impact of driverless cars on society, including their effects on employment, safety, and legal liability. I will provide a well-supported argument for whether or not driverless cars should be implemented on a large scale.\nThe first major impact of driverless cars will be on employment. Self-driving vehicles will eliminate the need for thousands of taxi and bus drivers, as well as truck and delivery drivers. This will create a significant unemployment problem, as most of these people will not have the necessary skills to find alternate employment. In addition, the elimination of the need for parking lots will likely result in the loss of thousands of jobs in the real estate industry, as many apartment complexes and office buildings will no longer need parking spaces.\nThe second major impact of driverless cars will be on safety. Self-driving cars will be much safer than human-controlled vehicles, as they will be able to avoid obstacles and traffic accidents more efficiently. In addition, driverless cars will not get tired or distracted, which means that they will be less likely to cause accidents. Finally, self-driving cars will not drink alcohol or use drugs, which will greatly reduce the number of car accidents caused by drunken driving.\nThe third major impact of driverless cars will be on legal liability. Most car accidents are caused by human error, which means that the driver is often held legally responsible for the incident. However, driverless cars will not have anyone to blame if they cause an accident, which will likely result in a decrease in the number of lawsuits filed against car manufacturers.\nOverall, self-driving cars will have a significant impact on society, including the loss of thousands of jobs, an increase in safety, and a decrease in legal liability. The benefits of this technology outweigh its drawbacks, which is why I believe that driverless cars should be implemented on a large scale.\n\nThank you very much for your time. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\nBest regards,\nX\n\nI would be very grateful if you could provide me with feedback on my essay. I will be able to provide you with a TWE essay if you would like to help me out with that. Thank you!\n\n- Like x 1\n\nThe essay is well organized and the body paragraphs are well constructed.

    "Rumors are often spread, and they are also hard to disprove. This is true for the \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" rumor. People who believe that this rumor is true, also believe that the face on Mars is a representation of a human face, but this is clearly not the case. In fact, the face on Mars was proven to be a hoax by scientists. The face on Mars was proven to be a hoax by scientists because the face is actually a rock, and the photograph was taken by a low quality camera, which is why the face on Mars was not properly captured. \n\nThere were several scientists who observed the face on Mars, and they all concluded that the face on Mars was actually a rock. Carl Sagan, who was a scientist, concluded that the face on Mars was a rock. He said that \"the face on Mars is not a face, but a mere illusion created by a combination of shadows and lighting. It is a rock, not a face\" (Sagan). Other scientists, such as Christopher McKay and David Morrison, also concluded that the face on Mars was a rock. They also stated that \"the face on Mars is a rock that was misidentified as a face by a low-quality camera\" (McKay and Morrison). The scientists' observations and statements show that the face on Mars was a rock, and not a face. \n\nThe face on Mars was proven to be a hoax by scientists, because the photograph was taken by a low-quality camera. The photograph that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 Orbiter, which was a low-quality camera. The low-quality of the camera caused the face on Mars to be misidentified as a face. The photographer did not even realize that the image he captured was not a face, but simply a rock. \n\nThe face on Mars was proven to be a hoax by scientists, because the photograph was taken by a low-quality camera.

    "Driverless cars will soon become a reality. However, while the benefits of driverless cars are numerous, there are also drawbacks that should be considered. This essay will examine the potential benefits and drawbacks of driverless cars, including their ability to prevent accidents and the possibility of incorporating entertainment systems. It will also examine the use of cameras to monitor drivers and the potential for boredom while waiting for a turn to drive. Finally, this essay will evaluate the overall potential of driverless cars and make a recommendation for their future use.\n\nFirst and foremost, one of the benefits of driverless cars is that they will prevent accidents. The number of accidents caused by human error is staggering. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Association, 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error, and there are over 30,000 traffic deaths every year in the United States. Driverless cars will be able to detect and avoid accidents caused by human error and prevent thousands of deaths every year.\n\nAnother benefit of driverless cars is that they will be able to incorporate entertainment systems. This will allow the driver/passenger to watch television or play video games while traveling. While this may be a benefit for some, others will find this to be a problem. Drivers must be focused on the road at all times, and having an entertainment system in the car will distract the driver and may cause accidents.\n\nFinally, driverless cars will be able to monitor the driver. For example, if the driver falls asleep, the car will be able to stop. This will prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue. However, this may also cause problems. If a parent is driving their child to school, the car will be able to detect that the parent is not paying attention and will stop the car. This will cause the child to be late for school or even miss the bus. It is important to note that the child will",
    "There are many situations in which people face difficulties and stress. Not only is it important to deal with these situations in an effective and efficient way, but it is also important to get advice from others. This is especially the case if the problems are related to feelings and/or thoughts, for instance, in the case of depression and suicide. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of seeking advice and multiple perspectives in dealing with stressful situations, using the example of the higher rate of suicide among men due to their reluctance to share their feelings. I will also discuss how seeking advice and considering different viewpoints can lead to a more positive outlook and better outcomes in various situations, such as relationships and academic challenges.\n\nFirst of all, it is important to get advice and multiple perspectives in dealing with stressful situations, like depression and suicide, because you can get a different perspective on your situation, which can allow you to see things differently. This can also help you to see things that you might have missed before. For example, in the case of depression and suicide, people might not only be depressed because of their situation, but they might also be depressed because they have other problems, such as a lack of friends and/or a lack of a social life. This is partly due to the fact that men are less likely to open up about these problems than women are, which is why men are more likely to commit suicide. However, if they would open up to others about their situation, they might realize that they don\u2019t need to commit suicide, since their situation is not as bad as they think it is. This is why it is important to get advice and multiple perspectives in dealing with stressful situations.\n\nIn addition to the fact that it is important to get advice and multiple perspectives in dealing with stressful situations, it is also important to get advice and multiple perspectives in dealing with other situations, such as relationships and academic challenges. This is because you can get a different perspective on your situation, which can allow you to see things differently. For example, in the case of relationships, it is important to get advice and multiple perspectives, because you might not realize that your partner is unhappy with the relationship, unless you talk to them about it. This is because it is not always obvious that your partner is unhappy with the relationship. However, if you would talk to them about it, you might realize that they are unhappy with the relationship, which can lead to a more positive outlook and better outcomes in the relationship. This is why it is important to get advice and multiple perspectives in dealing with relationships.\n\nOverall, it is important to get advice and multiple perspectives in dealing with stressful situations, because you might not realize that your situation is not as bad as you think it is. In addition to this, it is important to get advice and multiple perspectives in",
    "It is not acceptable for students with a C average to play in sports games.

    "As traffic congestion and air pollution continue to increase, more and more countries are considering the idea of implementing car-free policies. While a car-free city can be beneficial to the environment, it can also have negative effects on society. Additionally, car-free cities have been implemented successfully in some countries but have been unsuccessful in others. This essay will discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of limiting driving and implementing car-free cities in terms of reducing air pollution and traffic congestion. This essay will also analyze the potential challenges of time management and fines for driving on restricted days. Lastly, this essay will provide examples of successful implementation of car-free policies in cities such as Paris and Bogota and evaluate their effectiveness.\n\nTo begin with, there are many benefits to having a car-free city. First, limiting driving would significantly reduce air pollution. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is responsible for approximately seven million deaths worldwide each year. It is the biggest environmental risk factor for disease and death. Second, a car-free city can reduce traffic congestion. As more people begin to drive, the number of vehicles on the road increases. This causes traffic congestion, which can cause stress, frustration, and lead to accidents. Lastly, a car-free city can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, transportation accounts for nearly one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, which is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, limiting driving and implementing car-free policies can significantly reduce air pollution, traffic congestion, and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn contrast, there are many negative effects to having a car-free city. First, a car-free city can negatively impact people\u2019s lives. For example, if a city is car-free, people will have to find other ways to get around. This can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and frustration. Second, a car-free city can be difficult to implement. For instance, if a city is car-free, there will be no parking spaces available. This can cause people to have to walk long distances to get to their destination. Lastly, a car-free city can be expensive. For instance, if a car-free city is implemented, people will have to find other ways to get around. This can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and frustration.

    "What is an ancient alien artifact? An ancient alien artifact is defined as any man-made object that is found on earth or any other planet that is believed to be of extraterrestrial origin. The author believes that the face found on Mars is not an ancient alien artifact because of the rock formations on every planet, the deceiving nature of pictures, and the lack of scientific proof of alien existence.\n\nThe first reason the author believes the face found on Mars is not an ancient alien artifact is because of the rock formations on every planet. The author states that \u201call planets have a face\u201d (para. 2). Therefore, if there was an ancient alien artifact on Mars, there would also be one on Mercury, Venus, and Earth. Because there is not any evidence of an ancient alien artifact on Mercury, Venus, and Earth, the face found on Mars must be a natural rock formation. The author argues that the face found on Mars is a natural rock formation because there are rock formations on every planet. The author says, \u201cAll planets have a face\u201d (para. 2). The author\u2019s logic is flawed because there are rock formations on every planet. However, the author is incorrect in saying that all planets have a face. The planet Uranus has no face.

    "Extracurricular activities are an important part of a student\u2019s life. I believe that extracurricular activities are important because they teach children time management, help children discover their passions, and help children figure out their main priorities in life. I will further argue why students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nFirstly, extracurricular activities can help children discover their passions. Children who play sports are more likely to be in a good mood and feel less stressed than children who do not play sports. In addition, participating in extracurricular activities can help children discover their passions. For example, a child who enjoys playing tennis can participate in tennis camps, clinics, and leagues to help them discover their passion. A child who likes to play the piano can join a piano club, take piano lessons, and participate in piano recitals. In addition, a child who loves to read can participate in a book club and read books in the club. These are just some of the many activities a child can participate in to discover his or her passions.\n\nSecondly, extracurricular activities can teach children time management. If a child is participating in a sports team, he or she will have to attend practice and have to attend games on weekends. If a child is participating in a book club, he or she will have to read the books and write a book report. If a child is participating in a piano club, he or she will have to practice the piano and perform at a recital. The above are just some of the many examples of how extracurricular activities can teach children time management. In addition, extracurricular activities can teach children to prioritize. For example, a child who is in a basketball team will have to attend practice and games. If a child has a test on Friday, he or she will have to study and prioritize what is more important. This will help children learn to prioritize.\n\nFinally, extracurricular activities can help students learn to balance their life. If a child is in a sports team, he or she will have to balance his or her time between school and sports. If a child is in a book club, he or she will have to balance his or her time between school and reading. If a child is in a piano club, he or she will have to balance his or her time between school and practicing the piano. The above are just some of the many examples of how extracurricular activities can help children balance their life.\n\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities are important because they can help children discover their passions, teach children time management, and help children balance their life. I will further argue why students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nHow to cite this page\n\nChoose cite format:\n\nBenefits of Extracurricular Activities for Middle School Students.

    "Distracted driving is a global issue that has become a major cause of road accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,477 people died in 2015 in the United States due to distracted driving. This is a 9% increase from 2014. The National Safety Council states that 391,000 people were injured in 2015 in the United States due to distracted driving. A distracted driver is a driver who engages in other activities while driving, which can result in the public\u2019s loss of life, property damage, and injuries. Distracted driving can occur due to the use of mobile phones, texting while driving, eating, grooming, talking to passengers, and many other activities. The phenomenon of distracted driving is a global issue that has become a major cause of road accidents. It is a significant public health issue that is often neglected. I believe that distracted driving is a major issue and that it is important to discuss the issue and propose solutions to prevent accidents caused by negligent drivers. In order to support my argument, I will use statistics and personal experiences to support my argument and consider the potential effectiveness of implementing fines, license suspension, and imprisonment for vehicular manslaughter. Additionally, I will explore the possibility of self-driving cars and alternative transportation options as a means to eliminate distracted driving.

    "Education has become monotonous and unengaging due to the rigid structure of the American education system. Students are forced to attend school for 12 years, and they are required to take the same courses and subjects. They are forced into a system in which they are required to listen to lectures and read books and essays that are assigned to them. They are forced to take tests and write essays that are graded by their teachers. This entire process is boring and monotonous. Students are not allowed to design their own projects, and they are not allowed to work on things that they enjoy. They are forced to engage in activities that they are not interested in. In addition, they are not allowed to work with other students, and they are forced to work independently. As a result, they do not learn how to work with other people, and they do not learn how to cooperate with other people.

    "A person's life is filled with decisions. They start from the most basic things such as what to eat for breakfast, to more complex decisions such as what career to choose. In order to make the right decision, people often seek advice from others. This essay will discuss the benefits of seeking advice from multiple people before making a decision, using examples from everyday life and politics.\n\nPeople seek advice from others because they hope to get the right answer. For example, a student can ask her friends for advice before choosing her university. If the student is unsure about her choice, she might ask her friends who have already chosen their universities. She can ask them what they think about their universities and what they like about them. The student can also ask her friends about the subjects they are studying and what they think about them. This will help her decide which university to choose. The benefit of seeking advice from others is that they provide different opinions. For example, if a student chooses a university that is not good, her friends will tell her and she can choose another university. This will give her a chance to choose a better university. Another benefit is that people can learn from others. For example, if a student asks her friends what they think about her university, she can learn from them. She can learn from their experiences and improve her decision-making skills.\n\nAnother reason for seeking advice from others is that they might know more than the person seeking advice. For example, a student can ask her friends about what university to choose. If her friends have already chosen their universities, they might know more about them than the student. They can tell her about the subjects they are studying and what they like about them. This will help her decide which university to choose.\n\nIn conclusion, people seek advice from others because they hope to get the right answer. The benefit of seeking advice from others is that they provide different opinions. Another reason for seeking advice from others is that they might know more than the person seeking advice.\n\nThe essay is 546 words long. I would like to know if there are any mistakes. I would especially like to know if these topics are suitable for a 10th grade student. I am not a native speaker, so I am not sure if this essay is grammatically correct. I would appreciate it if you could correct my mistakes and give me feedback on how to improve my essay.

    "With the availability of information and communication technology, it is easier than ever to connect with individuals from all around the world. This has led to a dramatic increase in the number of people who are seeking advice from others, in order to make better informed decisions. While there are both positive and negative aspects to this, I believe that seeking multiple opinions and advice is generally beneficial.\n\nOne of the most important benefits of seeking advice is that it can help the person seeking it to broaden their perspective. It is common for people to have a narrow perspective, because they only seek advice from people who hold similar views to their own. However, when people seek advice from a broad range of individuals, they are more likely to become aware of alternative perspectives, which can help them to think about a problem in a different way. For example, if a person is considering whether they should quit their job to start a business, they could seek advice from a friend with a similar background, a friend with a completely different background, and a business mentor whom they respect. This would help them to evaluate the pros and cons of quitting their job in a more balanced way.\n\nAnother key benefit is that seeking advice can help to prevent mistakes. When people are making a decision, it is common for them to have doubts, and it is often hard to know whether they should act on these doubts. For example, if a person is considering whether to quit their job to start a business, they may have doubts about whether they will be successful. If they seek advice from others, they may be able to receive reassurance that their doubts are not justified. This could help to prevent them from making a mistake that they would later regret.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to seeking advice, I believe that it is generally beneficial. It can help people to broaden their perspective and prevent mistakes.\n\n[ Written by - Olivia ]\n\nIELTS CORRECTION PACKS\n\nHOT BONUS 1:\n\n2 courses for the price of 1\n\nHOT BONUS 2:\n\nfeedback & band scores for writing or speaking tasks\n\nHOT BONUS 3:\n\nLast Minutes IELTS Tips guide\n\nHOT BONUS 4:\n\nexclusive community of IELTS candidates\n\nHOT BONUS 5:\n\nan EXTRA 10% off\n\nGet Started Now\n",

    "The majority of people face a tough choice at least once in their lifetime. This choice is frequently accompanied by a problem, which will be solved only by making a decision. Making a decision by oneself can be hard, because one cannot be sure that the decision will be correct. Seeking advice from multiple people can be beneficial, because it brings several advantages. This essay will provide examples of these benefits.\n\nOne advantage of seeking advice from multiple people is that the decision maker can obtain a wide variety of opinions. When facing a certain problem, it is easy to feel lost and not know what to do. This is the opportunity to ask friends, family, and coworkers for their opinions. If the decision maker is open-minded and does not take the advice personally, he or she will be able to obtain a wide variety of opinions. This will give the decision maker a wider perspective of the problem, which will ultimately help him or her make a better decision.\n\nThe second advantage of seeking advice from multiple people is that the decision maker can get a fresh perspective. Another person\u2019s point of view can help the decision maker to look at the problem from a different angle. This can be very helpful, because it can open the decision maker\u2019s mind to new possibilities and ideas. This can help the decision maker to find a solution that he or she would not have thought of otherwise.\n\nThe third and final benefit of seeking advice from multiple people is that the decision maker can gain confidence. This happens when the decision maker realizes that the people he or she asked for advice are confident that he or she will make the right decision. This can help the decision maker to feel more confident. This can also help the decision maker to be more open to the advice given by the other people. This can ultimately help the decision maker to make a better decision.\n\nIn conclusion, seeking advice from multiple people can be beneficial, because it brings several advantages. These advantages are that the decision maker can obtain a wide variety of opinions, a fresh perspective, and confidence. This essay has provided examples of these benefits.\n\nThis essay has 513 words.

    "Summer projects for students are teacher-designed rather than student-designed, because of the importance of certain subjects, the tendency for students to choose easier topics, and the teacher's ability to tailor the project to each student's level.\n\nFirstly, the importance of certain subject has a great influence on the student's summer project. For example, the project on science and mathematics will be a compulsory project for all students, because the science and mathematics are the main subjects in school. Secondly, the student's tendency to choose easier topics is one of the reasons why the summer projects for students should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed. For example, if the students are allowed to choose their own topic, they will choose easier topics, because they fear that they will not be able to complete the project if they choose the difficult topics. Thirdly, the teacher's ability to tailor the project to each student's level is another reason for the teacher to design the summer project for the students. For example, if the teacher is able to design the summer project for each student, he/she will be able to give the project that is suitable to each student's level and ability.\n\nIn conclusion, the teacher's ability to tailor the project to each student's level, the importance of certain subjects, and the student's tendency to choose easier topics are the three reasons why the summer projects for students should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed.\n\nThank you very much for your help.

IELTS Writing Task 1 requires you to write a letter. IELTS Writing Task 2 requires you to write an essay. The essay is a formal piece of writing, which should be between 250-300 words. In Task 2, you are given an essay topic and you are asked to write at least 250 words. You have 40 minutes to write your essay. But, you should spend at least 10 minutes planning your essay. You can use the following format for your essay:\n\nIntroduction: This should be a brief introduction to the topic. You should give your opinion in the introduction. For example, you can write, \"I agree that...\" or \"I disagree that...\". You can also write, \"I believe that...\". You can also write, \"I think that...\". You should not write your opinion in the body paragraphs. You should write your opinion in the introduction only.\n\nBody Paragraph 1: This is the first body paragraph of your essay. The topic of this paragraph should be \"First Point\". For example, if the topic is \"Should students be allowed to choose their own topics?\", you should write about the first point in this paragraph.

    "The Electoral College system in the United States presidential elections has its advantages and disadvantages. However, the Electoral College system should be replaced with a popular vote system.\n\nThe Electoral College system has its advantages in the United States presidential elections. The Electoral College system is a system that selects the president of the United States. Candidates must win a majority of votes in a majority of the states\u2019 electoral votes. If no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, the election is thrown to the House of Representatives (Harris, 2008). The Electoral College system is more democratic than a popular vote system. It is more democratic because it gives voters in smaller states the same voting power as voters in larger states. For example, in the 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush won the state of Florida by a very close margin. Bush\u2019s victory gave him enough electoral votes to win the election. However, if the popular vote was used instead of the Electoral College system, Al Gore would have been declared the winner of the election. The Electoral College system is also more democratic because it gives all citizens a voice in choosing the president. If the popular vote were used instead of the Electoral College system, only states with large populations would matter in the presidential election. In the 2000 presidential election, citizens in smaller states would have been ignored. For example, in the 2000 presidential election, Bush won the state of Florida by a very close margin. However, in the state of New York, Gore won by a very large margin. The 2000 presidential election would have been decided by the citizens of the state of Florida if the popular vote were used instead of the Electoral College system. So, the Electoral College system is more democratic than a popular vote system.\n\nThe Electoral College system has its disadvantages in the United States presidential elections.

    "In today\u2019s world, it is not uncommon to find people seeking advice on various topics. However, seeking advice is not a simple task, as it requires a lot of research and time. I am going to explain three ways to avoid getting multiple conflicting responses when seeking advice on a topic. I will also provide examples of reliable sources for advice and discuss the importance of applying the advice to real-life situations. Additionally, I will discuss the importance of sharing knowledge and being a trustworthy source of information.\n\nFirstly, one should check if the person advising him or her has the necessary knowledge and experience to provide advice. Secondly, it is important to find someone who has dealt with the situation before. Thirdly, the person seeking advice should only take advice from a source that is reliable. For example, a person should not take advice from a person who has never dealt with a situation before. Additionally, the person seeking advice should also take advice from a reliable source, such as a book or a website. Finally, one should apply the advice he or she has received to real-life situations. For example, if a person wants to quit smoking, he or she should try to quit smoking.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to share knowledge and be a trustworthy source of information. People should share knowledge and their experiences so that others can also benefit from it. Furthermore, people should also be a trustworthy source of information. For example, if someone asks for advice, he or she should give an honest answer.\n\nTo conclude, people should always seek advice from people who have the necessary knowledge and experience to provide advice. Additionally, people should only take advice from a source that is reliable. Finally, people should apply the advice they have received to real-life situations.

    "The Electoral College is a system in which the voters in each state vote for a candidate for president and vice president. These votes are taken to determine the President and Vice President. The Electoral College system was created by the founding fathers of the United States to prevent a small group of people to choose the president and vice president. This system is a combination of the election of the president and vice president by the people and by the individual states. The president and vice president are chosen by the Electoral College. The candidate who receives the majority of the electoral vote wins the election. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes in the Electoral College is elected president.\n\nThere are two methods in using the Electoral College. The first method is called the \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d system. In this system, the candidate who receives the most votes in a state gets all the electoral votes from that state. The other method is called the \u201cproportional representation\u201d system. In this system, the candidate who receives the most votes in a state gets the number of electoral votes that is proportional to the percentage of votes received in that state. The winner-takes-all system is used in 48 states and the District of Columbia. The proportional representation system is used in Iowa and Nebraska. The Electoral College has been criticized for not accurately representing the will of the people. Critics argue that the Electoral College system is outdated and it is no longer useful in modern times.\n\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College is a system in which the voters in each state vote for a candidate for president and vice president.

    "The face on Mars is not created by aliens. People argue that the face on Mars is a proof of extraterrestrial life. This is not true because the face on Mars is just a trick of light and shadow.\n\nFirst of all, the face on Mars is not created by aliens. It is just a trick of light and shadow.

    "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a technique used for measuring facial expressions. It was developed in the 1970s by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen, and it is widely used in psychology to study emotions. FACS is based on the idea that facial expressions have a universal meaning and can be used to measure emotions. For example, sadness is indicated by a downturned mouth and raised eyebrows (Ekman & Friesen 1978). FACS is used in many different contexts, such as in forensic psychology to identify criminals and in advertising to create more effective marketing campaigns. This essay will discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of using technology to read facial expressions and emotions, such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), in personal and professional settings. Consider the ethical implications of using this technology, as well as its potential impact on mental health and privacy. Provide examples of situations where this technology could be useful, and also situations where it may not be appropriate or effective.\n\nFirstly, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) has many potential benefits. For example, it can be used to identify people who are lying. It can also be used to identify people who are at risk of committing suicide or violence. Furthermore, it can be used to monitor the emotions of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other disabilities. These benefits make FACS very useful in both personal and professional",
    "I strongly believe that community service should be required for all students in schools. The potential benefits of this policy include the development of student\u2019s responsibility and teamwork skills, as well as the promotion of a sense of empathy and social responsibility. The drawbacks of such a policy are the potential loss of interest in community service and the limited availability of volunteer opportunities for students.\n\n1st paragraph:\nThe first benefit of mandatory community service for students is the development of their responsibility and teamwork skills. Community service is a great way for students to spend their free time, instead of just hanging out with their friends. Community service will also teach students to be responsible for their community and to work together with other people to improve the community.\n\n2nd paragraph:\nThe second benefit of mandatory community service for students is the promotion of a sense of empathy and social responsibility. Students will learn to become more empathetic towards their community and will understand that their community is not perfect, and that people should work together to improve it. They will also understand the importance of social responsibility, and they will learn how to take care of their community.\n\n3rd paragraph:\nThe third benefit of mandatory community service for students is the promotion of a sense of empathy and social responsibility.

    "Lowering the grade requirement to a C average is a good idea for the following reasons. First, the C average is the minimum grade requirement for students to pass a class, so lowering the grade requirement to a C average will not affect students\u2019 academic performance. Second, the C average is the minimum grade requirement for students to be eligible to play sports. Third, it is possible to support students who may struggle academically while participating in sports.\nFirst of all, the C average is the minimum grade requirement for students to pass a class, so lowering the grade requirement to a C average will not affect students\u2019 academic performance. For example, in my freshman year, I had a C average, but I did not fail any of my classes. In fact, I passed all of my classes and did well in sports. Therefore, students with a C average will still pass their classes and do well in sports.\nSecond, the C average is the minimum grade requirement for students to be eligible to play sports. For example, in my sophomore year, I had a C average in my math class, but I still played on the basketball team. In fact, I made the all-district team. Therefore, students with a C average will still be eligible to play sports.\nThird, it is possible to support students who may struggle academically while participating in sports. For example, in my junior year, my math grade was a B, but I still played on the basketball team. In fact, I made the all-district team again. Moreover, the school hired a math tutor for me to help me with my math studies. Therefore, it is possible to support students who may struggle academically while participating in sports.\nTo sum up, lowering",
    "The planet Venus is one of the closest neighbors of Earth, and yet, it is the hottest planet in the Solar System. Venus is also the second brightest object in the sky after the Moon, and is regarded as the \u2018sister planet\u2019 of Earth. However, despite all the above facts, there are many reasons why scientists should not stop exploring this planet. This is because Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our Solar System, and exploring this planet will help us to learn more about our own planet. In addition, it is believed that life existed on Venus millions of years ago, and hence, exploring this planet will help us understand the evolution of life on Earth. In addition, the planet Venus is the only planet in the Solar System that has a surface with no craters, which means that this planet is the youngest of all the planets in the Solar System. Hence, scientists can use the planet Venus to study the formation of planets. In conclusion, scientists should continue to explore Venus because it is the most Earth-like planet in our Solar System, and because",
    "The Challenge of Exploring Venus\nThe author of the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" claims that scientists should explore the planet Venus. The author justifies his claim by analyzing the dangers and obstacles of exploring the planet and the solutions he proposes to overcome them. He also gives reasons why scientists should still try to explore it. The author effectively supports his claim by giving reasons why scientists should still try to explore it and by proposing solutions to overcome the obstacles of exploring the planet. However, he does not provide enough information about the dangers of exploring the planet.\n\nThe author justifies his claim by giving reasons why scientists should still try to explore it. He begins by explaining the importance of exploring the planet. He says that \"Venus has always been one of the most interesting and puzzling of the planets.\" The author adds that this is because Venus is similar to Earth in many ways. It is similar to Earth in terms of size, mass, and density. He also says that \"Venus is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and the Moon.\" The author claims that Venus is important to study because it can help us understand the history of the Earth and the solar system. He also says that \"Venus is the only other planet in our solar system with an atmosphere.\" He adds that \"the atmosphere is significantly thicker than Earth's.\" The author says that \"the atmosphere is very hot and dense.\" He also says that \"the surface of Venus is extremely hot, with temperatures reaching 900 degrees Fahrenheit (500 degrees Celsius).\" The author claims that \"the atmosphere is very dense and contains large amounts of sulfuric acid.\" He also says that \"the atmosphere is very dense and contains large amounts of sulfuric acid.\" The author claims that \"the atmosphere is very dense and contains large amounts of sulfuric acid.\" The author claims that \"the atmosphere is very dense and contains large amounts of sulfuric acid.\" The author claims that \"the atmosphere is very dense and contains large amounts of sulfuric acid.\"\n\nThe author also proposes solutions to overcome the obstacles of exploring the planet.

    "FACS technology is a new form of learning which uses a combination of technology and hands-on activities to engage students in a more interactive form of learning. It has been shown to be effective in improving students\u2019 grades and improving their ability to apply knowledge to real-life situations. This technology can be beneficial in the classroom, but can also have negative impacts on our society. The overreliance on technology for learning, the accessibility of the technology, and the potential decline in emotional intelligence are all potential negative impacts of implementing FACS technology in classrooms. The implementation of FACS technology in classrooms can have negative impacts on our society, but it can also be beneficial.\n\nFirst, the overreliance on technology for learning may have a negative impact on our society. FACS technology is a relatively new form of learning, and it is still being developed. As a result, it is not yet available in all classrooms. Although FACS technology is effective in improving students\u2019 grades, it is not a substitute for traditional learning methods. Traditional learning methods include reading textbooks, listening to lectures, and taking notes. These methods require students to focus on the material and take notes. FACS technology does not require students to focus on the material, which means that students may not learn as much as they would in a traditional classroom setting. This may lead to a decline in the quality of education in our society.\n\nSecond, the accessibility of FACS technology may have a negative impact on our society. FACS technology is expensive. It costs $500 per computer, and it takes 5 years to develop a new version of the software. This means that schools cannot afford to implement FACS technology in all classrooms. As a result, only students who have access to FACS technology will benefit from it. This may result in a decline in the quality of education in our society.\n\nFinally, the potential decline in emotional intelligence may have a negative impact on our society. FACS technology does not require students to interact with others. Instead, it requires students to interact with computers. This may result in a decline in social skills among students. This may lead to a decline in the quality of education in our society.\n\nIn conclusion, the overreliance on technology for learning, the accessibility of the technology, and the potential decline in emotional intelligence are all potential negative impacts of implementing FACS technology in classrooms. However, it can also be beneficial in the classroom. The implementation of FACS technology in classrooms can have negative impacts on our society, but it can also be beneficial.\n\nThank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSample Answer 4:\n\nIn the modern-day world, technology and education are closely related. The use of computers and other digital devices in classrooms is becoming increasingly common. However, as with any new technology, there are both positive and negative consequences.\n\nOne of the benefits of using computers in the classroom is that they can help students develop important skills. For example, using a computer helps students learn how to use a mouse and keyboard. This skill will be useful in the future when they have to type documents or use a computer for other tasks. Another benefit is that computers can help students improve their reading and writing skills. By using a computer, students can practice typing and reading more often. This will improve their literacy skills, which will benefit them in the future.\n\nHowever, there are also some negative consequences of using computers in the classroom. One of these consequences is that students may become too dependent on technology. If students spend too much time using computers, they may not learn how to do things without them. This can lead to a decline in their problem-solving skills and their ability to think creatively. Another consequence is that using computers may lead to a decline in students\u2019 social skills. Students spend less time interacting with each other when they are using computers. As a result, they may not develop the social skills they need to succeed in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, there are both positive and negative consequences of using computers in the classroom. The benefits outweigh the drawbacks because computers can help students develop important skills and improve their literacy skills. However, there are also some negative consequences of using computers in the classroom, such as students becoming too dependent on technology and having a decline in their social skills. Therefore, it is important to use computers in moderation and to make sure that students are not spending too much time on them.\n\nSample Answer",

    "The effect of reducing the number of cars on the road can be enormous. The space saved can be used to expand the roads for better public transportation. This would help to reduce air pollution. It would also encourage people to use public transportation, which is a trend in many parts of the world. In order to understand the effects of reducing the number of cars, it is essential to understand the problems that are caused by the growing number of cars. As the number of cars increases, the traffic congestion increases, which in turn leads to increase in fuel consumption, air pollution and health issues. In addition, parking on the roads is also becoming a major problem in many parts of the world. All these issues can be solved by reducing the number of cars.\n\nOne of the solutions to reduce traffic congestion is to increase the usage of public transportation. This can be achieved by encouraging people to use public transportation. For this to happen, the government should provide incentives such as giving discounts on public transportation fares to people who use public transportation. In addition, it is also important to provide enough parking spaces for people who don\u2019t use public transportation. This will help to reduce the stress on the roads, which is caused by people parking their cars on the roads.\n\nAnother solution to reduce traffic congestion is to provide better roads for public transportation. This can be achieved by expanding the roads, which is a trend in many parts of the world. In order to expand the roads, the government should buy the land from the people who own it. This will help to provide better roads for public transportation, which will help to reduce traffic congestion.\n\nMoreover, reducing the number of cars on the road can also help to reduce air pollution. This can happen when people use public transportation instead of using their cars. In addition, the government can provide incentives such as giving discounts on public transportation fares to people who use public transportation, which will encourage people to use public transportation.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many ways in which reducing the number of cars on the road can benefit the population. One of the ways is by increasing the usage of public transportation, which will help to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution and health issues. The other way is by providing better roads for public transportation, which will help to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.\n\nWord count: 415\n\nAmit Kumar\n\nI agree with you, this essay is much better than the previous one.

    "The article \u201cThe Challenge of Exploring Venus\u201d was written by Owen Gingerich in 1980. In this article, the author, Owen Gingerich, presents the difficulties of studying Venus in the past and now, and explains why it is important to study Venus. This essay will explain why studying Venus is important despite the dangerous conditions it presents, using evidence from \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" article.\n\nFirst of all, the author says that Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System with a temperature of 465 degrees Celsius (C) in the day time and 240 degrees C at night. The author also mentions that Venus is the driest planet in the Solar System, with no water or rain. Venus also has a very thick atmosphere, composed of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and a small proportion of oxygen. The author points out that Venus is the only planet in the Solar System that has no water or rain, and the carbon dioxide creates a greenhouse effect that traps heat and makes the temperature very high. These conditions make it very difficult to study Venus.\n\nSecondly, the author points out that Venus\u2019 atmosphere has made it very difficult for spacecraft to land on the surface of Venus. The author says that when a spacecraft is attempting to land on the surface of Venus, the extreme heat and pressure push the spacecraft down. This makes it very difficult for astronauts to land on the surface of Venus. The author also says that the technology to land on Venus does not exist yet. The only way to study Venus is to send spacecrafts to the surface of Venus, where the spacecrafts are destroyed by the extreme heat. The author also says that scientists have to land spacecrafts on the surface of Venus without any technology to guide the spacecraft down. This makes it very difficult for scientists to study Venus.\n\nFinally, the author says that the extreme heat on Venus makes it very difficult for humans to work there. The author says that Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System, with a temperature of 465 degrees C in the day and 240 degrees C at night. The author also says that the surface of Venus is covered with lava. The extreme heat and lava makes it very difficult for humans to work on the surface of Venus. The author also says that Venus is the driest planet in the Solar System, with no water or rain. The author says that the lava and the extreme heat make it very difficult for humans to work on the surface of Venus.\n\nIn conclusion, the article \u201cThe Challenge of Exploring Venus\u201d was written by Owen Gingerich in 1980. In this article, the author, Owen Gingerich, presents the difficulties of studying Venus in the past and now, and explains why it is important to study Venus.

This is a problem that has not yet been solved, but the development of driverless cars may be the answer. However, the introduction of driverless cars would lead to a number of problems.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of driverless cars is that they would be safer. Indeed, many accidents happen as a result of human error, and driverless cars would eliminate this problem. Also, driverless cars would be more efficient, as they are unlikely to get stuck in traffic congestion. Furthermore, they would be very convenient, as people could do other things while travelling, such as work or read a book. Finally, driverless cars would help to reduce congestion on the roads, and therefore, they would have a positive environmental impact.\n\nOn the other hand, driverless cars would be expensive. Indeed, they would be very costly to develop, and there is a chance that they could breakdown. Also, people would have to trust the technology, and there is a risk that it might fail. Finally, it is possible that driverless cars would lead to an increase in crime, as criminals could use them to commit more crimes.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are a number of potential benefits of driverless cars, there are also drawbacks that need to be addressed. However, it is likely that driverless cars will be more beneficial than detrimental to society.\n\n(389 words)\n\nThe Examiner's Comments:\nThank you for your essay.

    "I have faced a similar situation before, when I had to decide about my future career path. It was a very important decision for me, as my future career would affect my life for years to come. I was very confused at the time and the situation seemed very daunting. I was not sure whether the career path I had chosen was the right one for me. I really needed a second opinion to validate my decision.\n\nI decided to consult a friend of mine, who was studying in the same field as I was. He had already completed his studies and was working in the same field. I assumed that he would be able to help me choose the right career path. I was very surprised when he suggested that I should change my career path. He said that the field I was in was too competitive and that I would have to work very hard to get a job. I was very disappointed and started doubting my decision. Fortunately, I had a few more friends in this field. I decided to meet them and ask for their opinions. I was very happy when I met my second friend. He said that my decision was a good one and that I would be able to get a job in this field easily. He said that he had recently gotten a job in this field and that he was having a great time working there. I was very happy to hear this.\n\nAfter hearing all the opinions, I decided to stick to my decision. I felt that my decision was the right one and that I would be able to get a job easily. I am very happy with the decision I made and I am still enjoying my career. I am now an accountant and I am very happy with my job. I have no regrets about my decision.\n\nI think that it is very important to seek multiple opinions when making a decision. This is because each person has a different opinion about something. It is very rare for two people to have the same opinion about something. Therefore, it is very important to get multiple opinions before making a decision. This is because each person\u2019s opinion is different and it is very difficult to make a decision based on just one person\u2019s opinion.",
    "I strongly believe that allowing students to have cell phones in school is a good idea. I have a few reasons for this opinion. First of all, cell phones can become a useful tool in case of emergency. For example, if a student is absent from school, he or she can use his or her phone to contact a friend and ask about the homework assignments. In addition, cell phones can be a useful tool for teachers to contact students in case of emergency. For example, if a student gets sick during class, a teacher can call his or her parents to inform them about the situation. Finally, cell phones can be a useful tool for teachers to communicate with their students. For example, if a teacher forgets to bring his or her homework assignments, he or she can send the assignments to their students via text message.\n\nAlthough I think that cell phones can be a useful tool in a school environment, I think that there are some concerns that need to be addressed. For example, some students might be distracted by their phones while the teacher is lecturing. This might become a problem because, in some cases, it can be hard to control the students. In addition, some students might be tempted to use their phone to send text messages or browse the internet while the teacher is lecturing. This might become a problem because, in some cases, it can be hard to control the students. Finally, some students might be tempted to use their phone to send text messages or browse the internet while the teacher is lecturing. This might become a problem because, in some cases, it can be hard to control the students.\n\nTo minimize the distractions in the classroom, I think that teachers should be allowed to collect the students\u2019 cell phones during class time. In addition, teachers should be allowed to confiscate the students\u2019 cell phones if they are being used inappropriately. Finally, teachers should be allowed to confiscate the students\u2019 cell phones if they are being used inappropriately.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that allowing",

    "The prospect of offering distance classes from home is enticing for students, teachers and universities alike. The idea of being able to complete one\u2019s education from the comfort of one\u2019s own home is an attractive one. However, there are a number of potential risks and drawbacks that are to be considered before rushing to embrace this new trend.\nThe most obvious of these risks is that students may find it difficult to focus on their surroundings. This would mean that students would be more likely to lose focus on their studies, and it would also be more difficult to keep track of them. This is especially true for students who live alone, as they might be more likely to put themselves in danger.\nAnother potential risk is that students may not receive the same level of interaction with their peers as they would in a classroom setting. This would mean that students would not be able to develop the same level of social skills as they would if they were in a classroom setting. Finally, students may not be able to interact with their teachers as well as they would if they were in a classroom setting. This would mean that students would not have the opportunity to ask questions or receive feedback on their work.\nIn conclusion, while the idea of offering distance classes from home is very appealing, there are a number of potential risks and drawbacks that need to be considered before embracing this new trend.\n\nThank you in advance!\n",

    "Driverless cars are a revolutionary invention that is supposed to be introduced in the near future. Some people believe that the implementation of driverless cars is a good idea, while others think that it has more negative aspects. After reading the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" I have come to the conclusion that driverless cars are a bad idea. I am of the opinion that they will have a negative impact on the economy, promote less disciplined actions among teen and adult drivers, and increase the risk of accidents.\n\nFirst of all, driverless cars will negatively impact the economy. The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" states that the driverless cars will have a big impact on the economy. The article states that driverless cars will cut the number of cars needed by 80%. This means that there will be a lot less job opportunities in the auto industry. Furthermore, the article states that driverless cars will reduce the need for gas by 90%. This means that there will be less money spent on gas. This will result in a decrease in the taxes that are paid to the government. This will result in a decrease in the government funding to education, health care, roads, and other public services. This will result in a decrease in the quality of these services.\n\nSecondly, driverless cars will promote less disciplined actions among teen and adult drivers. The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" states that the driverless cars will be programmed to operate at the speed limit. This means that people will not have to worry about getting a speeding ticket. This will result in people speeding more and more. This will result in more accidents. This will result in more people being killed in car accidents. This will result in more people being injured in car accidents. This will result in more people being killed in car accidents.

This law will bring a lot of consequences to drivers who violate the law, and it will help a lot of people to stay safe while driving.\n\nUsing cell phones, texting, and other electronic devices while driving has become a major safety issue all over the world. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), every year 100,000 drivers use cell phones while driving. This is very dangerous, and it has caused a lot of accidents in recent years. In 2010 alone, 3,092 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers, and 416,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver (NHTSA).

    "With the ever-increasing rate of urbanization, the number of cars on the roads has increased dramatically. Many people believe that this has had a detrimental effect on the environment, increased traffic congestion, and reduced the quality of life for individuals.\nThere are at least three advantages to limiting car usage. The first is that it improves the environment. For example, a 2015 study by the University of California, Davis, found that in the United States, reducing car usage by 10% would save the equivalent of 15 million tons of emissions per year. This is because cars are responsible for 75% of air pollution generated by transportation. Secondly, it reduces traffic congestion. For example, in 2015, the average driver spent 101 hours in traffic. In addition, 27% of the time drivers spend in traffic is due to additional vehicles on the road. Finally, it benefits individuals. For example, in cities that have installed bike lanes, there has been an increase in the number of cyclists. In London, for example, the number of cyclists has increased from 37,000 in 2000 to 1.1 million in 2018. These cyclists now have access to dedicated lanes and are less likely to be involved in an accident.\nThe three main disadvantages of limiting car usage are that it is expensive, it is inconvenient, and it does not work. Firstly, it is expensive. For example, in many European cities, drivers have to pay a toll called a \u2018parking fee\u2019 or a \u2018congestion charge\u2019. In London, this is 11.50 pounds per day. Secondly, it is inconvenient. For example, in 2018, a study by the University of California, Davis found that in the United States, the average driver spent 15.5 hours per year looking for a parking space. Finally, it does not work. For example, the aforementioned study by the University of California, Davis found that in the United States, reducing car usage by 10% would save the equivalent of 15 million tons of emissions per year. However, the study also found that, in the United States, the number of cars on the road increased by 26% between 2010 and 2015.\nIn conclusion, I believe that limiting car usage has many advantages, including improving the environment, reducing traffic congestion, and benefitting individuals. However, I also believe that there are some disadvantages, including being expensive, being inconvenient, and not working.\n\nTotal words: 823\n\nPlease let me know what you think about my essay.

It can be programmed to drive from one place to another without any human intervention. It is a kind of revolutionary technology that may lead to a new era in the field of transportation. This new technology has both positive and negative aspects. The main positive aspect of driverless cars is that they are safe. People who are not good at driving can use them to reach their destination. As they are not driven by people, they are less likely to cause traffic accidents. Another positive aspect is that they are cheap. They can be programmed to drive from one place to another. Therefore, they do not need to spend their fuel to get to their destination.

    "Venus is the second planet from the Sun in the solar system. It is the hottest planet in the solar system, with an average surface temperature of 475 degrees Celsius. The surface of Venus is covered by a dense cloud of carbon dioxide, making it difficult to explore. However, there are several reasons why we should explore Venus, despite the challenges it presents. Firstly, we should study Venus to learn more about the Earth. Venus is the closest planet to Earth. Therefore, it is easy to study Venus to learn more about the Earth. Secondly, we should study Venus to learn more about our solar system. Thirdly, we should study Venus to learn more about the planets in our solar system. Fourthly, we should study Venus to help us understand the history of the solar system. Lastly, we should study Venus to learn more about the universe. In addition, we should study Venus because it is the closest planet to Earth. Therefore, it is the easiest planet to study. In conclusion, we should study Venus to learn more about the Earth, our solar system, and the universe. We should study Venus because it is the easiest planet to study. It is the closest planet to Earth, so it is easy to study. Therefore, we should study Venus.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nLast edited: Dec 19, 2018\n\n- Like x 1\n\nArdent \n\nJoined:\n\nOct 27, 2018\n\nMessages:\n\nLikes Received:\n\n1,850\n\nHi @Finn,\n\nWelcome to the forum.\n\nI'm afraid that I have to inform you that I'm not going to do your homework for you.

    "Athletes who have been playing for long time might not pay attention to their academic performance. Therefore, they may fail to complete their academic work. In this essay, I am going to discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of requiring a minimum grade requirement for students to participate in sports. I will also argue that it will be beneficial to have a minimum grade requirement for students to participate in sports.\nFirst, the benefits of requiring a minimum grade requirement for students to participate in sports are that it will make students more focused on their academic performance and help them to improve their academic grades. For example, if a student is playing football, he or she will have to attend the practice sessions. These sessions will help them to focus on their studies. For instance, if a student is playing football, he or she will have to attend the practice sessions. These sessions will help them to focus on their studies. On the other hand, if a student is not a part of any sports team, he or she will have more time to study. For example, if a student is not a part of any sports team, he or she will have more time to study. Another benefit is that it will help students to improve their health. For example, if a student is not a part of any sports team, he or she will have more time to study.\nSecond, the drawbacks of requiring a minimum grade requirement for students to participate in sports are that it will reduce",

I think that students should design their own projects to learn more about the topics that they are interested in. It is very important that students are engaged with what they are learning and when they are able to research a topic that they are interested in they will learn more and be motivated to do so. This is a more student-centered approach as students are the ones who are in control of their own learning. Teachers should not be the ones who are in charge of designing the projects as they may not be able to find a project that will be interesting and engaging for the students. For example, if a student hates math they are not going",
    "Schools should prioritize academic performance before extracurricular activities such as sports. This is because sports are a fun activity, but academic achievement is far more important. Sports activities can sometimes be a distraction from studies, which can be a problem in the long term. Also, sports activities can be physically and mentally demanding, which requires a lot of time and effort.\n\nTo begin with, sports are a fun activity. They are a great way to stay fit and healthy. They also help children to learn teamwork. Moreover, sports teach children to be disciplined. However, the main focus of a school should be academic performance. This is because a good academic performance can help children to get a good job in the future. In contrast, sports can be a distraction from studies as they require a lot of time and effort. This can be a problem in the long term. For example, if a child is not able to get good grades in an examination, they might feel stressed and become depressed.\n\nFurthermore, sports can also be physically and mentally demanding. They can take a toll on children\u2019s health. Moreover, they can be a source of injuries. Also, children can feel stressed because of sports.

    "Community service, also called volunteering, is a voluntary, unpaid activity which is done for the benefit of the community rather than for any personal gain or profit. It is a way to give back to the community and contribute to the welfare of others. It is a good way to help the community and the environment. It is a way to make the world a better place.\n\nCommunity service has many benefits for students. First of all, it helps students to be more responsible and develop a sense of civic duty. It also helps students to learn and practice the skills they are learning in school. For example, if students are learning about the environment, they can participate in community service projects that help protect the environment. Finally, community service helps students to build self-esteem and confidence. Community service can also improve academic performance. Students who participate in community service are more likely to do well in school.\n\nHowever, not all students can participate in community service. Some students may not be able to participate in community service because of their age or because they are not physically able to do community service. Some students may not be interested in community service because they do not think that it is important.\n\nTo encourage students to participate in community service, schools could require students to complete community service projects as part of their graduation requirements. Students could also be encouraged to participate in community service through their extracurricular activities, such as sports teams. Finally, schools could offer community service opportunities to students who are not interested in participating in community service.\n\nCommunity service can have a positive impact on academic performance and overall student well-being. Students who participate in community service are more likely to do well in school. They are also more likely to have a positive attitude toward school and their grades. Finally, students who participate in community service are more likely to graduate from high school.\n\nCommunity",
    "High schools should offer distance learning as an option for students who have part-time jobs because of the benefits and drawbacks for the students. Some of the major benefits of distance learning are that students can study anytime and anywhere. Some of the major drawbacks of distance learning are that students can get distracted easily and there is a lack of socialization. Based on the analysis, I recommend that high schools should approach distance learning for students with part-time jobs by requiring them to attend classes on campus at least once a week.\n\nDistance learning is beneficial for students who have part-time jobs because it allows students to study anytime and anywhere. Because students can study anytime and anywhere, they can maintain a work-life balance. For example, students who have part-time jobs can spend more time working because they do not have to travel to and from a school campus. Another example is that students who have part-time jobs can spend more time with their families because they do not have to travel to and from a school campus. Therefore, distance learning is beneficial for students who have part-time jobs because it allows students to study anytime and anywhere.\n\nDistance learning is detrimental for students who have part-time jobs because there is a lack of socialization. For example, students who have part-time jobs can get distracted easily. For example, students who have part-time jobs can spend more time on social media because they do not have to travel to and from a school campus.

    "It is important that students play a significant role in keeping the environment clean. In fact, it is advisable for students to help the community in several ways. However, there are at least two arguments against compulsory community service.\n\nOn the one hand, it is beneficial for students to be a part of the community. The main reason is that they can make a difference by cleaning the environment. Additionally, they can help elderly people who require assistance. In fact, it would be beneficial for students to be involved in projects that would improve the community.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not advisable for students to be involved in community service because it will be a distraction from their academic studies. For instance, it is not a good idea for students to be involved in social projects during the school year because it will affect their grades. Also, it is not advisable for students to be involved in community service during their vacations because it will affect their ability to find a job.\n\nTo conclude, it is advisable for students to be involved in community service because it will help them to improve the community.

    "I think that the new school law that requires students to have a C or higher in order to participate in sports is not fair to students who struggle academically. This law only makes them feel less confident and has a negative impact on them. I have two reasons to support my argument. First of all, the new school law does not help students who struggle academically. As a matter of fact, this law only makes them feel bad about themselves. If the law was put in effect, I would not be able to do what I like to do the most. I am very passionate about playing soccer. When I was in middle school, I was very bad at math and science. I was not able to get a C on my report card. I also had to go to tutoring. However, I did not let that stop me from playing soccer. I practiced hard to get better and I eventually got a C in math and science. I was very proud of myself and I did not let my grades stop me from playing soccer. Now that I am in high school, I realized that the new school law is not fair to students who struggle academically. I believe that I should be able to play soccer and do what I like to do the most even if I struggle academically. Second, the new school law is very expensive. It costs a lot of money for students to go to tutoring. I know that my parents have to pay for my tutoring. I do not think that my parents can afford for me to go to tutoring. I think that my parents will be very upset if I go to tutoring. In conclusion, the new school law is not fair to students who struggle academically. It only makes them feel bad about themselves and has a negative impact on them. I have two reasons to support my argument. First of all, the new school law does not",

    "In the current day and age, people are surrounded by a plethora of opportunities and options, which makes it difficult to choose the correct path in life. However, one can always seek advice and opinions from others to make the right decisions in terms of academics, job, and sports.\n\nIn the educational field, one can seek advice from their teachers, parents, and peers. For example, if a student is struggling with a particular subject, then he or she can seek assistance from their teachers, who will provide the student with information and tips on how to improve their grades. Similarly, if a student is unclear about what career path they should pursue, then they can seek advice from their parents and peers. For example, if a student is unsure of what college they should attend, then they can seek advice from their parents, who will provide the student with information on which colleges have the best academic and extracurricular programs. In addition, if a student is unsure of which major they should choose, then they can seek advice from their peers, who will provide the student with information on the various majors offered at different colleges.\n\nIn the workplace, one can seek advice from their supervisors, co-workers, and peers. For example, if a person is unsure of which tasks they should complete first, then they can seek advice from their supervisor, who will provide the person with information on which tasks are the most urgent. Similarly, if a person is unsure of how to complete a certain task, then they can seek advice from their co-workers, who will provide the person with information on the best way to complete the task. In addition, if a person is unsure of how long they should spend on a task, then they can seek advice from their peers, who will provide the person with information on how long they should spend on each task.\n\nIn the sports field, one can seek advice from their coaches, teammates, and peers. For example, if a person is unsure of which training exercises they should complete, then they can seek advice from their coach, who will provide the person with information on which exercises are the best for their particular sport.

In addition, if a person is unsure of how many games they should play per week, then they can seek advice from their peers, who will provide the person with information on how many games they should play per week.\n\nWhen seeking advice, one must be open-minded and respectful of other people\u2019s opinions.

    "Distance learning is a great option for students because it can address transportation issues, provide comfort, and reduce distractions. I will elaborate on these benefits in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirst and foremost, distance learning can address transportation issues. With distance learning, students can work from the comfort of their homes. This will reduce the need for students to travel to school, which will save them time and money. It will also reduce the need for parents to drive their children to school. In addition, it will reduce the amount of traffic on the road, which will improve the environment. It is evident that distance learning is beneficial for students and the environment.\n\nSecond, distance learning can provide comfort. Students can work on their assignments from the comfort of their homes. This will reduce the need for students to leave their homes.

    "Driverless cars are the future. Such cars have many benefits, such as saving lives and time, but they have many drawbacks, including safety issues and driver fatigue. \n\nFirstly, driverless cars have the potential to save lives. For example, many car accidents are caused by driver error. For example, a driver might be using a mobile phone or be too tired to drive safely. In contrast, driverless cars are equipped with many advanced safety features, such as automatic braking. In addition, driverless cars are also equipped with cameras and sensors, which are able to spot other cars and pedestrians. \n\nSecondly, driverless cars are more efficient. For instance, Google has conducted research on driverless cars and has found that they can drive more efficiently than human drivers. For example, they can drive in a more straight line and follow the rules of the road more closely. \n\nHowever, there are many safety concerns related to driverless cars. For example, one of the biggest concerns is that driverless cars will become dangerous if there is a problem with the software. For example, if a hacker were able to hack into the computer system of a driverless car, the car could potentially be controlled by the hacker. Also, driverless cars are not completely safe. For example, they are still prone to accidents caused by human error. \n\nIn conclusion, driverless cars are the future. Although they may have some drawbacks, such as safety concerns, they have many benefits, such as saving lives and time.\n\nFor more information, please visit http://www.essaypro.com/ or email us at support@essaypro.com\n",

    "Community service is an act of helping others and contributing to the society without expecting anything in return. It is done voluntarily and without any pressure. The idea of community service was introduced by former president of the United States of America, John F. Kennedy, who said that \u201cask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country\u201d. It is a great way to help improve the community by cleaning up the environment, helping those in need, and creating a better reputation for the community.\n\nThe environment is one of the most important things that need to be taken care of. It is the only place where we can live, so people should do their best to keep it clean and safe. For example, people can clean up the streets and remove all the trash that is lying around, or they can organize a recycling competition where they can collect all the recyclable materials and give them to the recycling center. This will help keep the environment clean. Another important way to improve the environment is to plant trees and flowers. It will help clean the air, and make the environment more beautiful.\n\nAnother important thing to do is to help those in need. People can help others by donating food, clothes, or money to help them. For example, people can donate clothes to the homeless, or they can donate money to help build a home for the homeless. These are just some of the many ways to help others.\n\nCommunity service is a great way to improve the environment and help those in need. It is also a great way to improve your reputation in the community. People who do community service are seen as good people, and people respect them more. This will help the community grow and become better.\n\nCommunity service has many benefits. It helps improve the environment and helps those in need. It also helps improve your reputation in the community. This is why community service should be mandatory for all students and adults.\n\nConclusion:\nCommunity service is an act of helping others and contributing to the society without expecting anything in return.

    "If students were allowed to attend classes from home, they would benefit from being able to access resources and support, and have more time to devote to hands-on experience.\nTo begin with, students can access resources and support from home. In particular, if students are struggling with their classes, they can seek help from their professors, tutors, and classmates. For instance, if students are taking a course in math, they can search for answers to their questions online, seek help from their professors, and ask their classmates to explain the material. In addition, students can access resources and support from home. For example, if students are taking a course in biology, they can go online to search for information, ask their friends and family to explain the material, and ask their professors for help.\nFurthermore, students can spend more time on hands-on experience from home. For example, if students are taking a course in chemistry, they can conduct experiments at home. In addition, if students are taking a course in biology, they can go to a nearby park to observe wildlife. In this way, students can devote more time to classwork, rather than being in class.\nOn the other hand, students would not benefit from attending classes from home. First of all, students would not have hands-on experience. For example, if students are taking a course in chemistry, they would not be able to conduct experiments. In addition, if students are taking a course in biology, they would not be able to observe wildlife. In this way, students would not be able to gain hands-on experience.\nIn conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they could access resources and support, and have more time to devote to hands-on experience. On the other hand, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would not have hands-on experience.\n\nit is my first time to write here, so I have no idea how you can evaluate my essay. could you please give me some suggestions to improve my essay?

    "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a system for the analysis of facial movements, which are used to express emotions. The system was developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in 1978. The use of FACS in national security and immigration processes would be beneficial for the following reasons. Firstly, this system would allow the authorities to identify potential terrorists. Secondly, FACS would help to detect illegal immigrants. Thirdly, this system would help to identify criminals. However, it would be inappropriate to introduce this technology in schools.\n\nThe system can be used by police to identify potential terrorists. If a suspicious person is identified, the authorities can detain him and investigate him. This would help to avoid terrorist attacks. FACS would also be useful in immigration processes. This system could help to identify illegal immigrants. If a person is identified as an illegal immigrant, he can be arrested and deported. The use of FACS would also help to detect criminals.

    "What is the controversy about the \"face on Mars\"?\nThe \"face on Mars\" is a strange and mysterious formation on the surface of the planet Mars. It is a natural formation, but it is still a mystery to the scientists. The controversy surrounding the \"face on Mars\" is whether it is a natural formation or not.\n\nWhat is the evidence that ultimately proved it to be a natural landform rather than a Martian monument?\nThere are several evidences that prove the \"face on Mars\" is a natural formation. The first evidence is that the \"face on Mars\" is located in the Cydonia region of Mars. This region is a desert and the \"face on Mars\" is located in this desert. The second evidence is that the \"face on Mars\" is a natural formation. It is made of rocks and the rocks have been eroded and shaped by erosion over thousands of years.

    "In recent years, we have started to see a lot of discussion about driverless cars. These are cars that use sensors, displays, and other technologies to drive and think for themselves. While many people are excited about the potential benefits of driverless cars, there are also many who are worried about the potential drawbacks. This essay will discuss both the benefits and drawbacks of driverless cars, as well as the role of manufacturers in ensuring driver attention and safety.\n\nOne of the most obvious benefits of driverless cars is that they can reduce the amount of fuel consumed. Since driverless cars are designed to drive more efficiently than humans, they can be programmed to drive more economically than humans. This means they will use less fuel than a human driver. Another benefit is that driverless cars are much safer than human drivers. As we know, humans are responsible for almost all car accidents. Driverless cars would eliminate this problem because they would be programmed to drive safely. Another benefit is that driverless cars can be programmed to drive in a way that is more suitable for the environment. For example, they could be programmed to drive only on roads that are designed to conserve energy, so that they use less fuel than human drivers.\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of driverless cars is that they are not flexible. A driverless car cannot go to places that are not programmed into it. For example, if you program a driverless car to drive to your home, it cannot go to your friend\u2019s house or the store. This means that driverless cars are not very flexible because they cannot go to places that are not programmed into them. Another drawback is that driverless cars cannot stop for pedestrians or other cars. If a driverless car is programmed to drive only on roads, it cannot stop for pedestrians or other cars because it does not have eyes. This means that driverless cars are not very safe because they cannot stop for pedestrians or other cars.\n\nThe role of manufacturers in ensuring driver attention and safety is very important. Manufacturers need to make sure that driverless cars are programmed to drive safely. This means they can be programmed to stop for pedestrians or other cars. They can also be programmed to drive on roads that are designed to conserve energy, so that they use less fuel than human drivers. Finally, manufacturers need to make sure that driverless cars have sensors that can detect when the car is about to crash. This means the car can stop before it crashes.\n\nThe potential implications of driverless cars for everyday life are very interesting. One implication is that driverless cars could make it easier for people to get around. This means driverless cars could be used by people who cannot drive, such as the elderly or disabled. Another implication is that driverless cars could make driving more enjoyable for people who enjoy driving, such as teenagers. Finally, driverless cars could make driving safer for people who cannot drive, such as the elderly or disabled.\n\nThe future of transportation is very exciting. Driverless cars could make driving safer for people who cannot drive, such as the elderly or disabled. They could also make driving more enjoyable for people who enjoy driving, such as teenagers. Finally, driverless cars could make it easier for people who cannot drive, such as the elderly or disabled, to get around.\n\nIn conclusion, driverless cars have many benefits, but they also have some drawbacks. The role of manufacturers in ensuring driver attention and safety is important. The potential implications of driverless cars for everyday life are very interesting, and the future of transportation is very exciting.\n\nI am looking forward to your kind reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAbdulaziz\n\n1 Like\n\nkayla (Kayla) 2018-06-22 20:58:15 UTC #2\n\n@Abdulaziz,\n\nI think your essay is well thought out and well written.

The face on Mars is not an alien formation, because the evidence from the scientific research and advancements in technology show that the face on Mars is a natural landform.\n\nFirstly, the face on Mars is not an alien formation, because it is a natural landform. The face on Mars is a natural landform because it was created by the same process that created all the landforms on Mars, which are different from the landforms on the Earth. For example, according to geological evidence, Mars has very few craters, while the Earth has many craters. This means that the face on Mars is not an alien formation, because it is a natural landform, like the rest of the landforms on Mars. This is because craters on Mars are few in number, and the face on Mars is not an alien formation, because it is a natural landform.\n\nSecondly, the face on Mars is not an alien formation, because the evidence from the scientific research and advancements in technology show that the face on Mars is a natural landform.

    "Many students nowadays prefer to study at online school, as it is more convenient and flexible for them. However, some people still believe that traditional school is better, because it is more interactive and provides more opportunities for students to interact with others. Moreover, some students feel more comfortable and confident in traditional classrooms. In my opinion, online school has a lot of advantages. Firstly, it is more flexible and allows students to learn at their own pace. For instance, some students are slow learners, and some of them are very fast. For them, traditional school is not a good option because they would spend a lot of time on doing something which is easy for them. Secondly, online school offers students the opportunity to learn the subject of their interest. For example, if a student is interested in business, he/she can easily find a course related to business online. Thirdly, online school is a great opportunity for students who have health issues. They can study at home and avoid going to school. Fourthly, online school provides opportunities to students to learn a new language.

    "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), developed by Paul Ekman, is a set of facial movements that can be used to measure the expression of emotions. It is used to identify facial expressions and to analyze them. FACS can be used in various fields such as education, video games, and surgery. The Mona Lisa, a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, can be used to demonstrate how FACS works and how it can be applied in various fields. It also shows the potential benefits and limitations of FACS and its impact on human communication.\n\nFirst, FACS can be used to demonstrate how it works. For example, FACS can be used to identify the Mona Lisa\u2019s facial expression. The Mona Lisa is known for her mysterious smile. According to the FACS, the Mona Lisa\u2019s smile is classified as a Duchenne smile, which is a smile that shows that the person is feeling genuine happiness and pleasure.

    "Extra curricular activities are a key component of a well-rounded education. They are an important part of high school that help students make new friends, develop their interests, and develop a sense of responsibility.\n\nI began to participate in extra curricular activities in junior high. The first I tried was basketball. It was very hard at first because I had never played before. I practiced a lot and eventually became good at the game. Basketball was a great way to make new friends and be a part of a team. I feel that the skills I learned playing basketball have helped me throughout my life. I learned how to be a good team player and how to work with others.\n\nLater in high school, I joined the student council. This was a great way to get involved in school and give back to my community. I enjoyed being a part of student council because I got to help organize school dances and other events. I also enjoyed working with other students on committees, such as the yearbook committee. I learned a lot about leadership and how to work with others.\n\nExtra curricular activities are a great way to relieve stress. They give students a chance to take a break from schoolwork and relax.

Is this essay good enough to get at least a 5?\n\nThank you!\n\nA few notes:\n\n- Your essay is a bit short for a 5/6. You need to add more details and more examples. A good way to do this is to write about a specific experience that you had.\n- You should use the word \"activities\" instead of \"activities.\"\n- You should add some adjectives to make your writing more interesting. For example, you could say that basketball was \"challenging\" or \"exciting.\"\n- It is okay to repeat some words, but try to use synonyms. For example, instead of saying \"basketball\" multiple times, you could say \"the sport\" or \"my favorite sport.\"\n- It is okay to use the same sentence structure multiple times, but try to mix things up a bit. For example, instead of saying \"Basketball is a great way to relieve stress,\" you could say \"Basketball is a great way to relieve stress because it gives students a chance to take a break from school",
    "Venus is the second planet of the Solar System. It is the hottest planet in the Solar System, due to its thick atmosphere that traps heat and light. The atmosphere of Venus is composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide and 3.5% nitrogen. It is a poisonous planet, with a surface temperature of 465 degrees Celsius. However, despite these dangers, there is an interesting feature on Venus that is worth exploring. The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" believes that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit despite the dangers it presents due to the potential for life, the possibility of finding water and the fact that it is the closest planet to Earth.\n\nFirstly, the author believes that it is worth studying Venus because there may be the potential for life. The author refers to \"the presence of microbes in the clouds and the possibility of subsurface life\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus, 2015). This suggests that there is a possibility that the clouds of Venus may contain microbes. If there are microbes in the clouds, then life may be present on the surface. This is an extremely interesting discovery, which is why the author believes that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit.\n\nSecondly, the author believes that it is worth studying Venus because it may contain water. The author refers to \"the presence of water in the clouds\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus, 2015). Therefore, if there is water in the clouds, then there may be water on the surface.

    "While the world's population continues to grow, the number of cars on the road has been increasing even faster. As a result, cities have been grappling with the detrimental effects of traffic congestion, air pollution, and urban sprawl. However, a number of cities have been able to mitigate these challenges by adopting policies that limit car usage, and these policies have had a significant impact on the aforementioned challenges. This essay will discuss the growing trend of \"car-free\" cities around the world, using examples from Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogota, Colombia. First, this essay will analyze the reasons behind these cities' decisions to limit car usage. Secondly, this essay will examine the impact it has had on air pollution, traffic congestion, and urban planning. Finally, this essay will examine the potential for this trend to spread to other cities, including those in the United States, and the challenges that may arise in implementing such policies.\n\nFirst, this essay will analyze the reasons behind these cities' decisions to limit car usage. A number of reasons have been cited for these cities' decisions to limit car usage. One reason is the environmental impact of cars. In particular, car exhaust is a major contributor to air pollution. Air pollution is a problem in many cities, but it is especially serious in cities with large populations. For example, a major problem in Los Angeles, California is smog. In order to address this problem, Los Angeles has enacted a number of policies aimed at reducing air pollution, including a ban on cars with a certain level of pollution. Other cities have also adopted policies aimed at reducing air pollution, including Bogota, Colombia. In 1986, Bogota implemented a plan to reduce air pollution by limiting car usage. In particular, the city implemented a congestion fee, which requires drivers to pay a fee to enter the city center during peak hours. Additionally, the city implemented a \"no cars\" day, which occurs every second Monday of the month and prohibits cars from entering the city center. These policies have had a positive impact on air pollution in Bogota. For example, in 2012, the city experienced a 30% decrease in air pollution as compared to 2002. Another reason cited for cities' decisions to limit car usage is the impact on traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can have a negative impact on the economy. For example, in 2014, traffic congestion cost the United States $124 billion. In order to address this problem, many cities have implemented policies aimed at reducing traffic congestion. For example, Bogota implemented a congestion fee in 1986, and this policy has had a positive impact on traffic congestion. For example, in 2012, the city experienced a 30% decrease in traffic congestion as compared to 2002. Another reason cited for cities' decisions to limit car usage is the impact on urban sprawl. Urban sprawl is a problem in many cities, and it can have a negative impact on the environment. For example, in 2014, urban sprawl was responsible for the conversion of 3.7 million acres of land into developed land. In order to address this problem, many cities have implemented policies aimed at reducing urban sprawl. For example, Bogota implemented a congestion fee in 1986, and this policy has had a positive impact on urban sprawl. For example, in 2012, the city experienced a 30% decrease in urban sprawl as compared to 2002.\n\nSecond, this essay will examine the impact it has had on air pollution, traffic congestion, and urban planning.

Other cities have also adopted policies aimed at reducing air pollution, including Bogota, Colombia. In 1986, Bogota implemented a plan to reduce air pollution by limiting car usage. In particular, the city implemented a congestion fee, which requires drivers to pay a fee to",
    "The Electoral College is a body that is elected by the people to elect the President and the Vice President of the United States of America. It is a system of indirect election of the President and the Vice-President of the United States. The system was established by the framers of the constitution in 1787 as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The system was established by the framers of the constitution in 1787 as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\n\nThe electoral college system is not perfect and has its own drawbacks. The biggest drawback of the electoral college system is that it does not provide an accurate representation of the majority of the people. For example, if a candidate wins the majority of the votes in a state, that candidate will be elected as the President of the United States. However, if the candidate does not win the majority of the votes in that state, that candidate may still be elected as the President of the United States if the electoral college votes in that state are divided between two or more candidates",
    "The debate on the use of cars in cities is still going on. Some people argue that cars are an essential part of modern life, while others think that cars are a menace to society. In my opinion, cars should be used less in cities.\n\nThe first benefit of reducing the use of cars in cities is that it reduces the number of accidents. According to a research by the World Health Organization, in 2016, 1.35 million people died in road accidents. If we use cars less in cities, the number of accidents will also decrease.\n\nThe second benefit of reducing the use of cars in cities is that it improves the environment. According to a report by the World Health Organization, in 2016, the number of deaths due to air pollution was 6.5 million. If we reduce the use of cars, the number of deaths will also decrease.\n\nThe third benefit of reducing the use of cars in cities is that it increases the number of pedestrians. According to a survey by the World Health Organization, in 2016, 55 million people died due to physical inactivity. If we reduce the use of cars, the number of people who walk in the city will increase.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that reducing the use of cars in cities is beneficial for all.

    "It is a well-known fact that the face of Mars is an extremely controversial issue. Some people think that it is a natural landform, while others believe that it was created by aliens. In this essay, I will analyze the controversy surrounding the face in Cydonia and give my opinion on this issue.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that the face was naturally created. In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author, David Morrison, argues that the face is a natural landform. Morrison explains that the face is a natural landform because of the \"dark material around the face\" (Morrison 15). Also, he notes that the \"dark material\" is a part of a \"crater rim\" (Morrison 15). Therefore, I believe that the face was created naturally.\n\nSecondly, I believe that the face was created by aliens. The author, David Morrison, claims that the face was created by aliens. He explains that the face is a \"computer simulation of a three-dimensional structure\" (Morrison 15). Also, he notes that \"the three-dimensional structure of the face was created by computer simulation\" (Morrison 15). Therefore, I believe that the face was created by aliens.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the face was created naturally.

    "A system in which a popular vote would elect the president of the United States, is a flawed system. A popular vote would cause several problems, with the largest problem being the amount of campaigning that would take place. The amount of campaigning would be increased tenfold, and the candidates would spend their time trying to get the votes of the people, instead of trying to find the best solutions to the country's problems. Another problem with a popular vote would be that the candidates would try to pander to the people, and tell them what they wanted to hear, instead of telling the people the truth. The final problem with a popular vote would be that the country would be split in half, and there would be no bipartisan support. It would be a system where the people would always be angry, and only the politicians would benefit.\n\nOP: Thank you for your response. I have a couple of questions.\n\n1. Why would the amount of campaigning increase tenfold? Wouldn't candidates simply campaign in the states that they would need to get the most votes?\n\n2.

In my opinion, I believe that students should not be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch time.\n\nFirst of all, cell phones are not allowed in schools. Students are also not allowed to use cell phones during lunch time. Therefore, students should not be allowed to use cell phones during lunch time. It is also a distraction to other students who are trying to eat, or are just talking to their friends. This can also lead to fights between students. There is also a possibility that students may get into trouble, such as getting into a fight, or getting caught cheating on a test. This can also be dangerous, such as students texting while driving, or texting during a class. Students should also not be allowed to use cell phones during lunch time because students can get distracted easily. Students should be focused on eating, and talking with their friends during lunch time.

    "Air pollution is a major problem in certain cities. It is caused by the pollution from cars and other vehicles. This essay will discuss the benefits of limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as biking and walking.\n\nOn the one hand, the increased car usage and the pollution from cars are the main causes of air pollution. In order to reduce this, people should use public transportation and bicycles instead of cars. This will reduce the pollution caused by cars and improve the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, cars are very convenient and they make our lives easier. They enable us to go anywhere we want, whenever we want. In addition, the use of cars reduces the time spent on transportation, which means that people can use this time to do other things, such as reading, working or studying. This is one of the main reasons why many people are reluctant to give up their cars.\n\nIn conclusion, although cars are very useful, people should limit their usage in order to reduce air pollution and the negative impact on the environment. It is therefore necessary to promote alternative modes of transportation such as biking and walking.\n\nThank you!\n\nWriting Feedback 1 Author: samuel\n\nYou have a few grammatical errors, but no real problems with the actual content of your essay.\n\nWriting Feedback 1 Author: 173\n\nThank you very much for your encouragement.\n\nI will try to improve my grammar in the future.\n\nWriting Feedback 2 Author: samuel\n\nYou're welcome.

    "The Electoral College is a system used to elect the President of the United States. The system has been around since the Constitutional Convention and was put in place to make sure that the country was not left with a tyrannical leader. The Electoral College is an important institution that has a significant impact on the American society. Unfortunately, the system is outdated, and it does not accurately reflect the voting power of the American people. This essay will argue that the Electoral College system is flawed and should be replaced with a direct election system. The essay will also discuss the importance of the Electoral College and how it is used to ensure that the President is elected by the American people.\n\nThe Electoral College system is outdated and does not accurately reflect the voting power of the American people. This is due to the fact that states with a smaller population are given the same number of electoral votes as larger states. The Electoral College system was put in place to prevent the large states from ruling over the small states. However, the system does not take into account the fact that states with smaller populations tend to vote differently than the larger states. This means that the Electoral College system actually gives more power to the larger states. This is unfair to the smaller states, and it is unfair to the American people as a whole.\n\nThe Electoral College system is also flawed because it does not accurately represent the voting power of the American people.

    "Driverless cars have the potential to change the way the world works. However, there are some dangers associated with this technology. Firstly, driverless cars are not yet as advanced as they need to be. In order for them to be able to drive safely, they require advanced technology, which, at the moment, is not available. Secondly, driverless cars often have difficulty understanding signals and in some instances, malfunctioning sensors. Furthermore, there is a risk that a driverless car will misunderstand a signal or that the sensors will malfunction. This is because the technology is not yet advanced enough to ensure that this will not happen. Thirdly, the risk of humans becoming bored or distracted while in a driverless car, and then causing an accident, is very high. For instance, if a driverless car is driving along and the driver is not paying attention to the road, there is a high risk that the car will crash. This is because the car will not be able to stop in time if an accident is about to occur. Finally, there are legal and ethical implications associated with driverless cars. For instance, if the driverless car crashes, who will be held responsible? Will it be the manufacturer? Will it be the owner? Will it be the driver? These are all questions which need to be answered. Overall, driverless cars are a good idea, but there are some dangers associated with them which need to be addressed.\n\nI have written a 309 words essay based on the above problem statement.

    "I agree that the 'Face on Mars' was a natural landform which was formed by the changing of the surface of the planet Mars by wind, water, and other natural elements. The Face on Mars, which was discovered in 1976, is an image of a face that is carved into the side of a mountain. It was taken by a Viking spacecraft that was orbiting Mars. The Face on Mars was first announced in 1976 by NASA. The image was examined by geologist Dr. Gilbert Levin and he stated that the face was a natural landform. He also stated that he was 'convinced' that the face was a natural landform. Levin also continued to say that the image was a 'feature of the landscape'. A natural landform is a landform that is not created by humans. The Face on Mars is a natural landform.\n\nThe Face on Mars is not an artifact left behind by aliens. The Face on Mars is a natural landform, so it cannot be an artifact left behind by aliens. An artifact is an object made by humans. The Face on Mars is not an artifact because it was not made by humans. Another reason the Face on Mars is not an artifact is because it is a natural landform. An artifact is a natural land form that is not natural. An artifact is also something that is not natural.

    "In the last decade, the use of cell phones in schools has become a controversial issue. Some people believe that it is a good idea to allow students to use cell phones in school, while others believe it is a bad idea. After a careful analysis of the two different policies regarding the use of cell phones in schools, I argue that the second policy is better than the first one, because it has a positive impact on student behavior and academic performance.\n\nOne reason why the second policy is better than the first one is that it has a positive impact on student behavior. It is a fact that students who use cell phones in school are more likely to cause disturbance in the classroom, because they are distracted by the cell phone. In contrast, students who do not use cell phones in school have better behavior, because they are not distracted by the cell phone. Therefore, the second policy is better than the first one, because it has a positive impact on student behavior.\n\nAnother reason why the second policy is better than the first one is that it has a positive impact on academic performance. It is a fact that students who use cell phones in school perform worse than students who do not use cell phones in school. In contrast, students who do not use cell phones in school perform better than students who use cell phones in school. Therefore, the second policy is better than the first one, because it has a positive impact on academic performance.\n\nTo conclude, the second policy is better than the first one, because it has a positive impact on student behavior and academic performance.",
    "In the United States, electing the president of the country is a complex task. The country's founding fathers created the Electoral College in 1787 to elect the president and vice president. The Electoral College was a part of the original Constitution; however, the term \"Electoral College\" was not used until 1804. This system of electing the president is not very democratic, and it is unfair to voters. Therefore, the Electoral College needs to be replaced with a popular vote system.\n\nThe Electoral College was created to prevent the election of a president by \"the people\" (Walker, 2017). The Electoral College was created because the founding fathers feared that the \"common man\" would elect a president who is not very qualified and that the country would be led by someone who is not a very good politician (Walker, 2017). The Electoral College was created to prevent the election of a president who is not very educated or intelligent. For example, if the president is elected by the citizens, then the president would not be able to distinguish between fact and fiction, and he or she might not be able to look at both sides of an issue (Walker, 2017).

For example, if the president is elected by the citizens, then the president would not be able to distinguish between fact and fiction, and he or she might not be able to look at both sides of an issue (Walker, 2017).\n\nThe Electoral College is not fair to voters. The Electoral College does not represent the true wishes of the people. The Electoral College is unfair because it gives the power to a few electors who have no true connection to the voters. For example, California has 55 electoral votes, but only 27 of those electoral votes go to the voters of California (Walker, 2017). The other 28 electoral votes are given to electors who are not from California and who are not connected to the people of California (Walker, 2017).

    "Extracurricular activities are an important part of any student's life. They play a crucial role in the development of an individual. However, it is not compulsory for everyone to participate in them. It must not be enforced. The reasons for this are as follows.  \n  \nFirstly, it is not possible for every student to participate in extracurricular activities. Some of them have an interest in sports, some in music, and some in drama. Some may not have an interest in any of these activities. Forcing them to participate in a particular extracurricular activity will not be beneficial for them. Furthermore, it may also cause unnecessary stress.  \n  \nSecondly, extracurricular activities are not a part of the curriculum. It is not a part of the course. So, if students are forced to take part in them, they will have to spend time on them instead of studying. They will not be able to perform well in their studies.  \n  \nThirdly, extracurricular activities are not necessary for students to participate in. They are not meant to be compulsory. If they are made compulsory, they will not be enjoyable anymore. Students will not be able to participate in them with full enthusiasm.  \n  \nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities are an important part of a student's life. However, it must not be made compulsory. They must be encouraged to take part in them. But, it should not be enforced.  \n \n\nThanks in advance.\n",
    "The use of cell phones while driving is a rising problem in our society today. Many people think it\u2019s not that big of a deal and don\u2019t really think about the consequences. I think that cell phones should be banned while driving because it can cause major accidents and it takes your attention away from the road. It is very dangerous and should be banned.\n\nThe first reason why cell phones should be banned while driving is because it causes major accidents.

    "When the topic of cell phones comes up in the classroom, it usually causes an argument. Some people think that cell phones are useful and should be allowed to be used by students during breaks and lunch periods. Other people think that cell phones are a distraction. Both of these arguments have good points. However, I believe that cell phones should be allowed to be used by students during breaks and lunch periods.\n\nFirst of all, cell phones can be used to help students with their studies. For example, if a student has a question during a class, he or she can send a text to a friend and get a quick answer. Also, cell phones can be used to help students with their studies outside of school. For instance, if a student has a math problem, he or she can use a cell phone app to get the answer. Finally, cell phones can be used to help students with their studies during breaks. For instance, a student can look up information about a subject on his or her phone.\n\nOn the other hand, some people think that cell phones are a distraction. For example, if a student is texting during a class, he or she might miss important information. Also, if a student is texting and walking, he or she could get hurt. Finally, if a student is texting and eating, he or she could choke or even drop their phone in their food.\n\nIn conclusion, there are good reasons for and against allowing cell phones in school. However, I believe that the pros outweigh the cons. Therefore, I think that cell phones should be allowed to be used by students during breaks and lunch periods.\n\nI have a question about the following sentence:\nHowever, I believe that cell phones should be allowed to be used by students during breaks and lunch periods.\n\nI am not sure if \"to be used\" is the right word choice. Is \"to be used\" correct or incorrect? If",
    "The topic of using phones during lunch and having them turned off during class is one that is controversial to say the least. I believe that a good compromise would be to allow phones during lunch but not during class. This is because students can use their phones to communicate with their friends and family, while also being able to use them to get information on the internet. However, during class, phones can be distracting and cause an unnecessary disruption to the learning process.\n\nTo begin with, phones can be a great way for students to communicate with their friends and family. For example, if a student has a question about their homework, they can easily look it up on the internet by using their phone. Similarly, if they are having a bad day, they can talk to their friends through their phones. This is important because it allows students to have a safe space where they can express themselves without being judged by others. On the other hand, during class, phones can cause disruption to learning. For example, if a student is texting during class, the teacher may not notice and will continue teaching. This can be frustrating for students who are trying to learn because they cannot concentrate on what is being taught.\n\nIn conclusion, while I believe that students should be allowed to use their phones during lunch, they should not be allowed to use them during class. This is because phones can be distracting and cause an unnecessary disruption to the learning process. However, during lunch, students can use their phones to communicate with their friends and family, while also being able to use them to get information on the internet.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJenny\n\n12/02/2021\n\nDear Jenny,\n\nThank you for your email.

    "As the world is evolving, the technology is also evolving with it. The use of electronic devices like cell phones and the Internet has become the most important part of human life. We use these devices for our own benefits, but sometimes they are also dangerous for us. Cell phones are the most dangerous devices for us, and they can cause a lot of accidents. Cell phones should be banned in public places, such as while driving, in theaters, and in meetings. The reasons are as follows.\n\nFirst, a driver who uses a cell phone while driving is not able to concentrate on the road. As a result, he may not be able to drive safely. In fact, a driver who is talking on the phone while driving is 4 times more likely to crash than a driver who is not on the phone. In addition, a driver who uses a cell phone while driving is also likely to receive a ticket from a police officer. Another reason is that a driver who uses a cell phone while driving is also likely to receive a ticket from a police officer.

    "The character of Luke Bomberger was introduced in the novel \u2018War Horse\u2019 written by Michael Morpurgo. In my opinion, he was a kind-hearted and selfless person who made many sacrifices to help the people in need. In this essay, I will discuss the positive and negative aspects of his journey, and also his selfless nature.\n\nTo begin, the positive aspects of his journey were that he was a selfless person who made many sacrifices to help the people in need. He was one of the soldiers who fought in the First World War. He was also a farmer who sold his cattle and horses to raise money to buy weapons. He did not have a lot of money, but he made sacrifices to help the people in need. He did not care about his own life or happiness, but only about helping others.\n\nHowever, the negative aspects of his journey were that he was a coward. He was afraid of dying and did not want to fight on the battlefield. He was also a liar. He lied to his family about why he went to war, but the truth was revealed when his parents found out that he had sold their cattle and horses to buy weapons. He also lied about his age, claiming that he was 18 years old when he was really only 17 years old.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that Luke Bomberger was a kind-hearted and selfless person who made many sacrifices to help the people in need. He was a coward, but he did not want to die. He was also a liar who lied to his family about why he went to war. However, he was a good person overall.\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this essay.

    "The Electoral College is a system in which the President and Vice-President of the United States is elected. It is a way of electing the President and Vice-President by a group of electors who are chosen to represent their state. The number of electors in each state is equal to the number of representatives and senators in that state. This system was founded in 1787, which was included in the United States Constitution. The Electoral College system was made because the founding fathers wanted to choose a person who was capable of leading the country, but they were also afraid that the common people would not be able to make a good decision. So, the Electoral College was chosen to be a group of people representing the state who would elect the president.\n\nThe process of the Electoral College is that each elector votes for the President and Vice-President. The electors\u2019 votes are cast by secret ballot and the votes are counted by the Congress. The meeting of the electors usually happens in the first week of December. After the meeting, the electors send their votes to the President of the Senate, who counts the votes and announces the President and Vice-President in January. Also, if no candidate gets more than 270 votes, the House of Representatives chooses the President and the Senate chooses the Vice-President.\n\nThe role of the voters in the Electoral College system is to choose the electors who will vote for the President and Vice-President. The voters are not directly involved in the election of the President and Vice-President, but they can influence the choice of the electors by voting for a political party. The voters can also influence the choice of the electors by voting for a candidate in the electoral college.\n\nThe Electoral College system differs from a direct popular vote because the voters do not directly vote for the President and Vice-President, but they indirectly vote for the President and Vice-President by choosing the electors who will elect them. Also, the voters can influence the choice of the electors by voting for a political party or a candidate in the electoral college.\n\nThe advantages of the Electoral College system are that it is more stable and less prone to disaster. Also, the Electoral College system is more democratic because the voters do not directly vote for the President and Vice-President, but they indirectly vote for them. Also, the voters can influence the choice of the electors by voting for a political party or a candidate in the electoral college.\n\nThe disadvantages of the Electoral College system are that it is less stable and more prone to disaster.

    "In today's world, a summer project is a common feature. It is a project carried out by students during their summer holidays. The main purpose of this project is to keep the students engaged in their studies and prevent them from forgetting what they have learnt during the academic year. However, the two months of summer vacation are a time for students to relax and have fun. Unfortunately, summer projects are a source of stress for students and they spend most of their summer vacation learning and working on their project. This essay will discuss how summer projects can be made more enjoyable and less stressful for students while still ensuring they don't fall behind on their learning.\n\nFirstly, summer projects should be made shorter. This means that students should not spend more than a month working on their project. They should also be given a month to work on their project instead of the two months they currently have. This would ensure that students have enough time left over to relax and enjoy themselves during their summer vacation.\n\nSecondly, summer projects should be more interesting and engaging. This could be achieved by introducing new topics or themes each year. For example, in the past, students were given a task to write a poem about their school or write about their favourite teacher. However, these topics are no longer interesting and students have become bored with them. Therefore, it is important to come up with new ideas every year so that students will have something new to work on during their summer vacation.\n\nThirdly, students should be given the option to choose their own project. This would enable them to work on something they are interested in rather than being forced to work on something they don't like. For example, if a student is interested in science, he or she could work on a project that involves building a volcano or designing a rocket. On the other hand, if a student does not like science, he or she could choose a project that involves writing a story about their favourite sport or animal.\n\nIn conclusion, although summer projects are necessary, they should not be made longer than a month and they should be more interesting and engaging.

    "The importance of seeking multiple opinions when receiving advice cannot be overemphasized as it leads to making better choices. This is because we tend to assume that we are right in our own way of thinking, which is not always the case. Receiving good advice from others will help us to avoid making mistakes that can lead to dire consequences. I have learnt this over the years and have also witnessed people making mistakes because they did not seek advice from others.\n\nI have seen many people making the wrong choices in life because they did not seek advice from others. For example, I have a friend who decided to get married to a man she met at a party just because he looked handsome. She did not seek advice from her parents or even her friends. She did not even ask the man to take her to his parents\u2019 house before saying yes. In the end, the marriage did not work out and she had to get a divorce. This is a good example of how seeking advice from others can help us to avoid making mistakes.\n\nI have also learnt to seek advice from others when making important decisions. For example, I am about to apply for a job with a large company, which will be a great opportunity for me. I am seeking advice from my friends and family members, who have worked in this company before, to help me make the right decision. I believe that seeking advice from others will help me to make a better choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the importance of seeking multiple opinions when receiving advice cannot be overemphasized as it leads to making better choices.

    "Cell phones are the most important and useful invention in this world. However, there are some people who do not agree with this idea. There are many advantages of having cell phones in the school, but there are also some disadvantages. In my opinion, students should have cell phones in the school. I will explain the advantages and disadvantages of having cell phones in the school and I would like to explain why we should have cell phones in the school.\n\nThe first advantage of having cell phones in the school is that the students will be able to contact their parents when they are in danger. For instance, if there is a fire in the school, the students can call their parents and let them know that there is a fire in the school, so that their parents will know where to pick them up. If the students do not have cell phones, their parents will not know where to pick them up, and they will not be able to find them.\n\nThe second advantage of having cell phones in the school is that the students will be able to contact their friends. For example, if the students are in the classroom and they need to use the toilet, but all of the toilets are occupied, the students can call their friends and let them know that they need to use the toilet, so that their friends will let them use the toilet. If the students do not have cell phones, they will have to wait until all of the toilets are free, and they will have to wait a long time.\n\nThe third advantage of having cell phones in the school is that the students will be able to contact their teachers. For example, if the students are in the classroom and they need to ask their teacher a question, but they do not know the answer, the students can call their teacher and let them know that they need to ask a question, so that their teacher will be able to answer their question. If the students do not have cell phones, they will have to wait until the teacher",

    "I think the benefits of implementing such a policy would outweigh the drawbacks. Many schools already have such a policy in place, however, I believe it would be better to make it mandatory. Such a policy would help to better the sporting performance of the schools as well as increase the motivation of the students. The policy would also make the students better qualified to take up future jobs.\n\nThe policy would be beneficial to the sporting performance of the schools. The students would be required to maintain a B average in order to participate in sports. The students would therefore be required to take their studies more seriously. This would aid in improving the sporting performance of the school. It would also make the students more disciplined and hardworking.\n\nThe policy would also help to increase the motivation of the students. The students would be forced to work harder in order to maintain a B average. They would also be forced to study more. This would help to increase their motivation.

    "When making a decision or seeking information, it is always a good idea to consult more than one source. This is because, in most cases, the second opinion is usually different from the first, and the second opinion might be more useful and accurate than the first, due to the fact that it comes from a different person. Seeking multiple opinions can be helpful in a number of situations, and can lead to a better understanding of the subject matter.\n\nThe first benefit of seeking advice from multiple sources is that it can help one make a more informed decision. For example, if I am deciding to buy a laptop, I might consult a friend, my brother and a salesperson at a computer store. My friend might recommend a particular model that he has been using and is happy with. My brother might suggest a model that he has read about in a magazine, whereas the salesperson might show me a model that is on display. If I were to consult only one of these people, I might end up buying a laptop that is not suitable for me, but if I consult all three, I will be able to make a more informed decision, by comparing the pros and cons of the three individual models.\n\nAnother benefit of seeking advice from multiple sources is that it can help one gain a better understanding of a subject matter. For example, if I am studying a particular topic in school, I might ask my teacher, my parents and a friend for help. My teacher might explain the topic from a textbook, my parents might explain it from their own experience, and my friend might explain it from a real-life example. If I were to ask only one of these people for help, I might end up not understanding the topic, but if I ask all three,",
    "The majority of people believe that attending traditional school is more beneficial than online schooling in terms of developing people skills, learning life lessons, and experiencing the full range of school activities. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. I believe that online schooling is more effective than traditional schooling. I have the personal experience to prove this.\n\nFirst, it is evident that online schooling is more effective in terms of developing people skills. I have been enrolled in online school for the past 2 years. During this time, I have made friends with students from all over the world. I have also developed my communication skills. For example, I have learned to communicate with people who have different cultural backgrounds. This is a necessary skill to have when you enter the professional world. Therefore, online schooling is more effective than traditional schooling in terms of developing people skills. \n\nSecond, online schooling is more effective than traditional schooling in terms of learning life lessons. I have been fortunate enough to have been raised by very loving parents. However, they did not teach me how to deal with the various problems that I have encountered in the real world. For example, my parents never taught me how to handle stress. They also never taught me how to deal with failure. Fortunately, I have learned how to deal with these aspects of the real world through online schooling. Online schooling has taught me how to handle stress. Online schooling has also taught me how to deal with failure. Therefore, online schooling is more effective than traditional schooling in terms of learning life lessons.\n\nLastly, online schooling is more effective than traditional schooling in terms of experiencing the full range of school activities. I have had the opportunity to take part in many extracurricular activities, such as dance, sports, and music. I have also had the opportunity to attend school field trips and participate in school dances. These are things that I would never have had the opportunity to do if I had attended traditional school. Therefore, online schooling is more effective than traditional schooling in terms of experiencing the full range of school activities. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that online schooling is more effective than traditional schooling in terms of developing people skills, learning life lessons, and experiencing the full range of school activities. I have the personal experience to prove this. I have never attended traditional school, but I have attended online school for the past 2 years. Therefore, I believe that I am qualified to make this claim. I have made friends with students from all over the world. I have also developed my communication skills.

    "Cell phones are everywhere. It is not possible to go out without seeing someone holding a cell phone in their hands. The trend of using cell phones is increasing every day. As a result, schools have started banning the use of cell phones by students. This is a controversial issue. While some people argue that banning cell phones will improve students\u2019 learning, others claim that cell phones will not only be beneficial for students but it will also help them to become more independent. This essay will discuss both the views and then conclude that cell phones should not be banned from schools.\n\nFirstly, cell phones are a distraction for students. Most students are addicted to their cell phones and cannot focus on their studies when they are in class. Cell phones have a lot of social media apps, like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. These apps are filled with videos and pictures of people that are more attractive than the instructor\u2019s lecture. Therefore, students get distracted from their studies and start to use social media apps on their cell phones. This is a major problem in schools. According to a study conducted by the University of California, 84% of students are distracted by their cell phones in class. As a result, students cannot focus on their studies and their grades suffer. This is why some schools have started to ban cell phones. They believe that banning cell phones will improve students\u2019 learning.\n\nOn the other hand, some people believe that banning cell phones will not make any difference because students will still use their cell phones even if they are banned. They argue that cell phones are important to students because they are a part of their everyday lives. For example, cell phones are important for students because they can be used for researching purposes. Students can research their homework on their cell phones, and they can also use the cell phone to take pictures of the whiteboard and continue their notes. Furthermore, cell phones can be used to communicate with their friends and family. This is why some people believe that cell phones should not be banned from schools because cell phones are an essential part of students\u2019 everyday lives.\n\nIn conclusion, cell phones are not only a distraction for students but they can also be used for positive purposes. Therefore, I believe that cell phones should not be banned from schools. Students should be allowed to use their cell phones in class because they can be used for positive purposes.\n\n",
    "Technology has always been a great invention of mankind. It has made our lives easier as we can do many things by sitting in one place. However, there are always negative aspects associated with every invention. The use of technology in reading and interpreting student emotions in a classroom setting is one such example. It is being argued that this technology can be used to identify students who are emotionally unstable and they can be given proper support.\n\nHowever, there are many ethical issues associated with this technology. First of all, it is a violation of students' right to privacy. Secondly, it may be used to manipulate students in unfair ways. Thirdly, it may be used to make students feel inferior and this may cause them to develop inferiority complex.\n\nTo conclude, it is a good idea to use technology to identify students who are emotionally unstable. However, it has many negative aspects which are hard to ignore.

    "Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a method of analyzing and coding facial expressions, developed by Paul Ekman, Wallace Friesen and John Doty in the 1970s. The method is used to analyze and code the facial expressions of both animals and humans. The FACS was developed as a tool for studying the facial expressions of emotion. The system was developed due to the fact that facial expressions were usually coded in a descriptive manner, using words such as \"happy\", \"sad\" and \"fearful\". These descriptive terms were often used to describe the facial expressions of animals, but were not always applicable to the facial expressions of humans. The FACS was developed as a tool to analyze and code facial expressions in a more precise manner.\n\nThe FACS can be used to improve the learning environment for students, and foster their commitment to education, in several ways. The FACS can be used to analyze and code the facial expressions of students in the classroom, and thus determine which teaching methods are most effective. The FACS can also be used to analyze and code the facial expressions of teachers and thus determine which teaching methods are most effective. Finally, the FACS can be used to analyze and code the facial expressions of students outside the classroom, and thus determine which teaching methods are most effective.\n\nThe FACS can be used to analyze and code the facial expressions of students in the classroom, and thus determine which teaching methods are most effective.

    "I\u2019m a student in college and I have taken classes from home and at school. I feel that taking classes from home and at school are both beneficial to a student. You get the opportunity to meet new people and interact with them. You get to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. You also get to take classes that are not offered at your school.\n\nBut at the same time, you are giving up a lot of the comforts of your home. You have to get up early, get dressed, and go to class. You also have to take a bus or a car to get there. And once you get to school, you have to sit in a classroom for a whole hour. You have to listen to a teacher lecture about something that you already know or something that you don\u2019t really care about. And you have to do homework every night. And if you don\u2019t do your homework, then you will fail the class.\n\nSo overall, taking classes from home and at school both have their advantages and disadvantages. They both have their own set of pros and cons. You just need to decide which one is best for you.\n\nI am very happy with the article I received. It was very well written and the grammar was excellent. I am very pleased with the service and will definitely use it again in the future.\n",

    "Driverless cars are a necessity because they will reduce traffic, save fuel, and protect the environment. They are also safe because they can avoid accidents. However, driverless cars are not safe because they are prone to hacking and can be dangerous.\n\nIn the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author argues that driverless cars are a necessity because they will reduce traffic, save fuel, and protect the environment. First, driverless cars will reduce traffic because they will automatically stop at red lights. In addition, driverless cars can drive in a straight line and will not need to swerve to avoid potholes or pedestrians. Driverless cars will also use less fuel because they will be able to drive in a straight line, without stopping and starting. Second, driverless cars will save fuel because they will automatically drive to the most efficient route. Third, driverless cars will protect the environment because they will be able to drive at the most efficient speed, thereby reducing emissions.\n\nOn the other hand, driverless cars are not safe because they are prone to hacking and can be dangerous. First, driverless cars are vulnerable to hacking because they are connected to the internet. In addition, driverless cars can be dangerous because they can malfunction. For example, driverless cars can malfunction if the battery runs out or if they are hacked. In addition, driverless cars can be dangerous because they lack a built-in entertainment system. Therefore, if a driver is bored, he or she may be tempted to use the car's entertainment system, which can lead to accidents. Furthermore, driverless cars are not safe because they are expensive. For example, a Tesla Model S costs approximately $100,000, which is too expensive for most people.\n\nIn conclusion, driverless cars are a necessity because they will reduce traffic, save fuel, and protect the environment. However, driverless cars are not safe because they are prone to hacking and can be dangerous.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\nJanet\n\nComments\n\nJanet, please read the essay again, and think about what you wrote, and what you meant to write, and if you agree with what you wrote. (As a side note, it is a good idea to check the grammar before submitting your essay.) The essay does not follow the prompt, and it does not have a clear thesis. You should also stop using the phrase \"In addition,....\" It sounds redundant and is not appropriate for formal writing. (If you look at the essay, \"In addition\" is used more than 10 times.) This essay is not ready for submission. You have to rewrite it. (I suggest you read some sample essays and learn how to write.) \nHi Janet, Your essay is not bad, but there are many things that you need to improve. First, you need to be careful with your grammar. In this essay, you made many mistakes. For example, you used \"the article\" instead of \"the article 'Driverless Cars Are Coming'\". Second, you need to be careful with your organization. In this essay, you wrote about the advantages of driverless cars before writing about the disadvantages. (You should write about the disadvantages first.) Third, you should write more. Your essay is too short. (It is only 275 words.) Fourth, you need to write an introduction and a conclusion. (You wrote the introduction, but you",

Finally, I will evaluate the importance of exploring Venus and the potential benefits of such endeavors for human curiosity and scientific knowledge.\n\nThe Earth and Venus share some similarities and differences. Both planets are terrestrial planets that have a rocky surface and a dense atmosphere. However, the Earth has a diameter of 12.7 kilometers and a mass of 5.97x10^24 kilograms, while Venus has a diameter of 12.1 kilometers and a mass of 4.87x10^24 kilograms.

    "Online schooling is a revolutionary system that has been introduced to the world in the last decade. It has been a great way for people to learn new things and expand their horizons. However, there are several disadvantages of online schooling. The biggest disadvantage of online schooling is the lack of social interaction. Social interaction is a very important factor in human development. Learning social skills is one of the most important factors for a child. Children are not able to learn social skills through online schooling. They are not able to play with their peers, and therefore lack the ability to develop social skills. This is a very serious issue, as it can have a long-term impact on the development of the child. Children who lack social skills are more likely to be bullied, and are more likely to have a hard time in school. Another disadvantage of online schooling is the lack of hands-on learning. In online schools, there is no hands-on learning. The students are only given an assignment to complete, and there is no interaction with the teacher. This can be a disadvantage for the students, because they are not able to learn through hands-on learning. The lack of hands-on learning can lead to a loss of interest in the subject, and can also lead to a lack of motivation to complete the assignments. The third disadvantage of online schooling is the lack of time management. The students are not given a schedule to follow, and are not required to keep track of the time they spend on their assignments. This can lead to a lack of motivation, and can also lead to a lack of time management. The fourth disadvantage of online schooling is the lack of ability to retain information. The students are not able to retain information through online schooling, because they are not able to interact with the teacher. The lack of ability to retain information can lead to a lack of motivation to complete the assignments, and can also lead to a lack of time management. The fifth disadvantage of online schooling is the lack of motivation to complete the assignments. The students are not able to retain information through online schooling, because they are not able to interact with the teacher. The lack of ability to retain information can lead to a lack of motivation to complete the assignments, and can also lead to a lack of time management.\n\nGet Help With Your Essay\n\nFind out more\n\nCite This Work\n\nAPA\n\nMLA\n\nMLA-7\n\nHarvard\n\nVancouver\n\nWikipedia\n\nOSCOLA\n\nEssays, UK.

    "Online courses are a very popular means of relieving stress for students. However, online courses have both benefits and drawbacks in comparison with face-to-face classes. I would like to discuss the effectiveness of online courses by considering the benefits and drawbacks of taking classes from home versus attending school in person.\n\nOnline courses can bring many benefits for students. First of all, students can learn at their own pace. Because students can decide when to study, they can study when they are in good conditions. For example, students can study when they feel relaxed. Moreover, online courses can save time and money. Because students do not have to commute to school, they can save time and money. For example, students can use the time and money they save to buy books or pay for the internet. Furthermore, online courses can provide a more diverse and wider range of classes. Because online courses provide classes from many universities, students can take classes from their favourite universities. For example, students can take classes from their favourite universities without moving to the other cities.\n\nHowever, online courses have some drawbacks. First of all, it is difficult to learn in an online course. Because students do not have a teacher who teaches in person, they cannot ask questions when they are confused. For example, students cannot ask questions to their teachers when their teachers do not answer their questions in the forum. Moreover, students cannot communicate with their teachers or other students in an online course. Because students cannot talk to their teachers, they cannot ask questions or talk about the content of the course. For example, students cannot ask questions and talk about the content of the course to their teachers. In addition, students cannot receive feedback from their teachers in an online course. Because students cannot receive feedback from their teachers, they cannot improve their skills. For example",
    "Distance learning is a teaching method that allows students to learn in their homes and at their own pace. The teacher is not physically present in the classroom, but can be reached by phone or email. Distance learning is very popular in the USA. Some people think that distance learning is more beneficial than traditional learning for students who are ill, socially anxious, or academically advanced. This essay will examine the benefits of distance learning for these three groups of students.\n\nFirstly, distance learning is beneficial for students who are ill. If a student is ill and needs to stay home from school, distance learning allows this student to continue his or her education without falling behind. In addition, distance learning can be a good option for students who have certain medical conditions, such as autism. For example, a student with autism may find it difficult to sit in a classroom and concentrate on a teacher, so distance learning can be a good alternative.\n\nSecondly, distance learning is beneficial for students who are socially anxious. An example of this would be a student who is afraid to get up in front of the class and give a speech. For this student, distance learning can be a good alternative. It gives the student a chance to practice his or her speech in front of a computer screen, without having to worry about what other people think.\n\nFinally, distance learning is beneficial for students who are academically advanced. This is because distance learning allows these students to work at their own pace. For example, a student who is very bright may find it difficult to sit in a classroom with other students who are not as bright. Distance learning allows this student to work at his or her own pace, without having to worry about what other students think.\n\nIn conclusion, distance learning is a good option for students who are ill, socially anxious, or academically advanced. It allows these students to continue their education without having to worry about missing school.",
    "Extracurricular activities are a very important part of a student\u2019s life. By participating in extracurricular activities, a student can learn a lot of skills that are beneficial to his/her life. In this paper, I will analyze the benefits of participating in extracurricular activities and explain how these activities can help students succeed in school and life.\n\nFirst, extracurricular activities help students develop social skills. It is very important for students to learn how to interact with each other. Extracurricular activities provide students with a chance to interact with each other in a non-academic environment. By interacting with each other in an environment that is free from academic pressures, students can learn how to communicate effectively with each other.\n\nSecond, extracurricular activities help students develop leadership skills. By participating in extracurricular activities, students can learn how to lead a group of people. For example, if a student is a member of a school band, he/she will learn how to lead a group of people who are also members of the band. This is an important skill that can be used in real life.\n\nThird, extracurricular activities help students develop problem-solving skills. This is an important skill that can be used in real life. For example, if a student is a member of a school band, he/she will learn how to solve problems that arise during the performance of the band. This is an important skill that can be used in real life.\n\nFinally, extracurricular activities help students develop time management skills. This is an important skill that can be used in real life. For example, if a student is a member of a school band, he/she will learn how to manage time. This is an important skill that can be used in real life.\n\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities are very important for students. By participating in extracurricular activities, students can learn a lot of skills that are beneficial to their life",
    "Schools should require all students to participate in extracurricular activities. The main reason for this is that such activities help students develop useful skills. For example, team sports teach students how to work with others; they learn to listen to each other and to compromise. In addition, students learn to plan and organise their time. They learn to set goals and to achieve them. Another benefit of extracurricular activities is that they help students to make new friends. They can meet people with similar interests and hobbies and they can share their love of the same sports or other activities. Furthermore, they can learn from each other and exchange ideas. They can also develop leadership skills and become role models for others. Finally, they can have fun and relieve stress by doing something they enjoy. They can develop new hobbies and interests and they can feel more confident and relaxed.\n\nThe second main reason for requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities is that it is good for their health. Many of these activities are good for their physical fitness. For example, most team sports require students to run and use their muscles. They also improve their cardiovascular fitness. This has many benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. In addition, team sports are good for their mental health. They can have fun and feel relaxed and happy. They can release tension and feel positive about themselves. Furthermore, they can improve their communication skills and become more confident. They can learn to speak in public and to debate. They can also make new friends and meet people with similar interests and hobbies.\n\nThe third main reason for requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities is that it is good for their future. For example, it can help them develop useful skills that can be useful in their careers. They can learn how to work as a team and how to negotiate. They can learn to plan and organise their time and to achieve their goals. Furthermore, they can learn useful skills such as communication and leadership. These skills can help them in their job interviews and in their careers. They can also make new friends and meet people with similar interests and hobbies. This can help them develop useful connections that can be useful in the future. In addition, it can help them develop hobbies and interests. This can help them relax and feel more confident.\n\nIn conclusion, schools should require all students to participate in extracurricular activities. The main reason for this is that such activities help students develop useful skills. The second main reason is that it is good for their health. The third main reason is that it is good for their future. In conclusion, schools should require all students to participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nLinks to this post \n\nLabels: essay, IELTS, IELTS writing, writing task 2 \n\nWriting task 2: model essay, band 9\n\nWednesday, 29 January 2020\n\nI kindly request you to compose an essay with 543 words, based on the following problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\nMany people believe that it is important to protect the environment in which we live.

    "When making a decision in a situation where one lacks confidence or is biased it is always important to seek advice from another person, which may lead to a fair and just decision. In my opinion, seeking advice from an independent third party is the best way to determine a fair and just decision.\n\nIn the first place, seeking advice is always a good idea because it helps the decision-maker to see the situation from many different angles. For example, in the case of a business transaction, the potential buyer may consider only the price of the product and not the quality of the product. A third party can advise the buyer to consider other factors such as quality, delivery time, payment terms, etc. In such a case, the buyer may get a better deal if he/she listens to the third party.\n\nMoreover, seeking advice can prevent a person from making a biased decision. For example, in a court case, the judge may give a biased decision if he/she is not open to the opinion of the third party. He/she may be influenced by the opinions of the prosecution and defense attorneys. However, if he/she listens to the third party\u2019s opinion, he/she may make a fair and just decision.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that seeking advice is a good idea as it can help the decision-maker see the situation from many different angles. This, in turn, can help him/her make a fair and just decision.\n\nYou should spend about 40 minutes on this task.\n\nWrite about the following topic:\n\nYou have decided to give several hours of your time each month to improve the community where you live. What is the problem you want to solve? Who could help you? Use specific reasons and details to develop your plan.\n\nYou should write at least 250 words.\n\nMODEL ANSWER:\n\nWhen one lives in a community, it becomes a moral responsibility to work for its development. I have decided to spend some hours in a month to improve my community. I would like to work on providing free education to the children of the poor families.\n\nThe problem I want to solve is the lack of free education for the poor children in my community. The number of such children is increasing every year. This is a very serious problem that needs to be solved. I would like to work on this project because the poor children are not getting the right kind of education. They will not be able to get jobs and earn money in the future. This is the reason why I want to help them.\n\nThe person who can help me in this project is my friend. He is from a poor family. He dropped out of school due to financial problems. He is now working as a construction worker. He is a very hardworking person. I know he would be willing to help me. He can help me in finding the children who need education. He can also help me in finding the poor families in my community.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that I am very keen to help the poor children in my community. I want to work with my friend to provide free",
    "The importance of getting advice and opinions from other people is widely known. I believe that getting opinions from different sources and people is advantageous for several reasons. I will first discuss the benefits of getting advice from others, and then present two examples from different fields.\n\nIt is important to get opinions from others because it can help us look at things from a different perspective. For example, imagine that you are at the last stage of designing a new line of shoes. You have worked hard on this project for months and you are quite proud of the end result. You are so happy with your shoes that you do not want to make any changes. However, you should ask for other people\u2019s opinion and advice before making any final decisions. If you do not, you might miss out on the opportunity to improve your design. By listening to the feedback of others, you can understand the different perspectives of others and come up with new ideas. For example, you might receive feedback from a potential customer, who might tell you that they prefer a different color. This feedback can be incredibly valuable for your business because it provides you with new ideas for the future.\n\nIn addition, seeking advice from others can help you gain a broader perspective. When designing a new product, for example, it is important to understand the needs of a wide variety of people. If you only ask for advice from your friends and family, you might not get a clear picture of the needs of your target audience. However, if you seek advice from a large number of people, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the needs of your target audience. For example, you might discover that your friends and family are not representative of your target audience. You may find that many people prefer a different color or style of product. By considering the needs of a wide variety of people, you can make sure that your product is successful and applicable to a larger audience.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that getting advice and opinions from others is beneficial because it can help us look at things from a different perspective. By seeking advice from a large number of people, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of different perspectives and come up with new ideas. In addition, seeking feedback from multiple sources ensures that the outcome is successful and applicable to a larger audience.\n\n[Written by a native speaker]\n\nGCSE English Essay\n\nThis is a much more difficult task.

    "Venus has been a mysterious planet for a long time. The planet is the second closest to the Sun, but it is the hottest planet in the Solar System. The temperature on Venus is 460 degrees Celsius and the atmospheric pressure is 93 times higher than on Earth. Hence, it is difficult to study Venus. However, with the new technology, it is possible to study Venus and explore the planet. NASA is preparing to launch a spacecraft to Venus in 2028, which will help to explore the planet. The technology will help to study Venus and discover new information about the planet's past and potential for future exploration. Additionally, it will also help NASA to develop new technologies for future space exploration. The technology will help NASA to launch new spacecraft to study other planets in the Solar System. NASA has been studying Venus for a long time, but it is difficult to send spacecraft to Venus because of the extreme temperature and atmospheric pressure. However, with the new technology, it will become easier to study Venus and other planets.

    "It is undeniable that the use of cell phones while driving is a serious threat to road safety. Despite the necessity of cell phones in emergency situations, the use of hands-free devices is still a major cause of car accidents.\n\nFirstly, cell phones are a major cause of car accidents. According to a recent study, the use of cell phones while driving is responsible for 1.6 million car accidents every year, resulting in 330,000 injuries and 12,000 deaths. Cell phones often distract drivers from road safety. According to a recent study, drivers who talk on cell phones are four times more likely to crash than drivers who are not using cell phones. In addition, drivers who use hands-free devices are still at risk of car accidents. According to a recent study, drivers who talk on cell phones are four times more likely to crash than drivers who are not using cell phones. In addition, drivers who use hands-free devices are still at risk of car accidents. According to a recent study, drivers who talk on cell phones are four times more likely to crash than drivers who are not using cell phones. In addition, drivers who use hands-free devices are still at risk of car accidents. According to a recent study, drivers who talk on cell phones are four times more likely to crash than drivers who are not using cell phones. In addition, drivers who use hands-free devices are still at risk of car accidents.\n\nSecondly, the use of cell phones in emergency situations can also be dangerous. According to a recent study, drivers who talk on cell phones are four times more likely to crash than drivers who are not using cell phones. In addition, drivers who use hands-free devices are still at risk of car accidents. According to a recent study, drivers who talk on cell phones are four times more likely to crash than drivers who are not using cell phones. In addition, drivers who use hands-free devices are still at risk of car accidents.\n\nThirdly, arguments for the necessity of cell phones in emergency situations and for business purposes contribute to drivers\u2019 inability to focus on road safety. According to a recent study, drivers who talk on cell phones are four times more likely to crash than drivers who are not using cell phones. In addition, drivers who use hands-free devices are still at risk of car accidents.

    "In the future, self-driving cars may become commonplace and people may choose to drive them for many reasons. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of driverless cars and examine whether such a technological advance is a necessity for society. I will argue that self-driving cars are not inherently advantageous, but they may provide some benefits that are worth considering.\n\nFirstly, self-driving cars are not necessarily a good idea for a number of reasons. One of the most prominent issues is the fact that they may take away the enjoyment of driving. Many people find driving to be relaxing, and that is one of the main reasons why they choose to do so. In addition, self-driving cars may actually be more dangerous than traditional cars, since they are not operated by humans. This is especially true in the event of an emergency, where a human driver may be able to react more quickly than a machine. Finally, self-driving cars may be susceptible to hacking, which could lead to serious consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some benefits to self-driving cars. For example, they may be more environmentally friendly than traditional cars, since they require less energy to operate. Also, they may be safer than traditional cars, since they can avoid accidents by recognizing and avoiding obstacles in their path. In addition",
    "In today's world, people have a tendency to seek advice from many different sources. In my opinion, seeking advice from multiple people is a good thing because it provides a person with a different perspective on the situation, helps them make better decisions, and makes them more successful in life. However, seeking advice from multiple people has some drawbacks as well. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits and potential drawbacks of receiving advice from various sources, including the importance of discerning between good and bad advice. I will also provide examples to support my argument.\n\nWhen a person seeks advice from multiple people, he/she gains a different perspective on the situation. This is especially true when the person seeking advice has a limited viewpoint on the situation. For example, a person who is trying to decide whether or not to start a business will receive many different answers from his/her friends, family members and colleagues about whether or not they should start the business. Some people will encourage the person to start the business, while others will discourage the person from starting the business. However, the person will only be able to make a good decision if he/she can discern between the good advice and the bad advice. If the person doesn't discern between the good advice and the bad advice, then he/she won't be able to make a good decision.\n\nAnother benefit of seeking advice from multiple people is that it helps the person make better decisions. This is because the more people the person seeks advice from, the more opinions they will get about the situation. If the person seeks advice from only one person, they may not get all of the opinions that they need to make a good decision. For example, if a person is trying to decide whether or",
    "I am writing to you to request you to compose an essay of 216 words, based on the subsequent problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\nExplain why the face on Mars is not caused by aliens and provide evidence to support your argument.\n\nEssay:\n\nExplain why the face on Mars is not caused by aliens and provide evidence to support your argument.\n\nThe face on Mars is a prominent feature of the Cydonia region of the planet Mars. The face is a recurring theme in science fiction, and has been a source of speculation and mystery.\n\nThe face is located on the Cydonia region of Mars. It was first photographed by the Viking 1 orbiter in 1976. The image was analyzed by the Viking 1 image processing team, who concluded that the features were natural in origin, and not a product of erosion, artificial construction, or other terrestrial phenomena. The face was featured in the 1978 book The Monuments of Mars: A City on the Edge of Forever, by Richard C. Hoagland and Mike Bara. In the book, the authors suggest a possible extraterrestrial origin for the \"Face\", including that the face is a statue of an alien being, and that the \"Face\" is a representation of a pyramid.\n\nUnlike the face, the pyramids also located in the Cydonia region are not disputed. The Cydonia region has been studied by many robotic missions, including the Viking orbiters, Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, and Mars Reconnaissance",
    "It is no doubt that many students are joining extracurricular activities. Some schools are trying to force students to participate in extracurricular activities. However, I believe that schools should not force students to participate in such activities.\n\nFirst of all, I think that forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities is not a good idea. It is because they will not be able to choose the activities they want to participate in. As a result, they will not be able to be interested in extracurricular activities. They will be forced to participate in them. As a result, their attitude towards extracurricular activities will become negative. For instance, if students are forced to join sports, they may not be interested in sports. As a result, they will not be able to perform well in sports. They will not be able to enjoy sports. In the end, they will not be able to benefit from sports.\n\nOn the other hand, I think that schools should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities. It is because it will not be able to motivate students to participate in extracurricular activities. If schools force students to join extracurricular activities, they will not be interested in extracurricular activities. As a result, they will not be able to perform well. They will not be able to enjoy extracurricular activities. In the end, they will not be able to benefit from extracurricular activities.\n\nIn conclusion, schools should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities. It is because it will not be able to motivate students to participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nIn conclusion, schools should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities.

    "It is a well known fact that our brain can be fooled into perceiving something that is not actually there. However, the phenomenon of visual illusions and how they can fool the brain is not well known. The following essay will present an example of a visual illusion that caused people to perceive something that was not actually there, and will discuss the role of resolution and perception in shaping our understanding of visual stimuli. Finally, it will consider the broader implications of this phenomenon for our understanding of the universe and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\nThe phenomenon of visual illusions and how they can fool the brain is well illustrated by the case of the \"Face on Mars\", which was first observed in 1976 by Viking 1. The face was clearly visible on the surface of Mars and it was assumed by many people that it was an artificial structure. However, since the original image was taken, a better resolution image of the surface of Mars was taken by the Mars Global Surveyor. This image clearly shows that the \"Face on Mars\" is actually an optical illusion created by the slope of the terrain. In fact, the \"Face on Mars\" is a mesa, or a flat topped hill.\n\nThe role of resolution and perception in shaping our understanding of visual stimuli is clearly illustrated by the \"Face on Mars\" case. In order to perceive the \"Face on Mars\", one must have a preconceived notion that there is something artificial on the surface of Mars. One must also have limited information about the terrain of the planet. In the case of the \"Face on Mars\", the limited information about the terrain of Mars, such as the slope of the mesa, was not available to the people who first saw the image of the \"Face on Mars\". As a result, they were fooled by the optical illusion caused by the slope of the mesa and perceived the \"Face on Mars\" as an artificial structure. In fact, the \"Face on Mars\" was only visible at a certain resolution of the camera. When the resolution of the camera improved, the \"Face on Mars\" was no longer visible.\n\nThe broader implications of the \"Face on Mars\" case are important for our understanding of the universe and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The first implication is that we must not assume that an object is a certain way just because we see it a certain way. In the \"Face on Mars\" case, the people who first saw the image of the \"Face on Mars\" assumed that it was an artificial structure. However, when a better resolution image of the surface of Mars was taken, it was clear that the \"Face on Mars\" was actually an optical illusion created by the slope of the mesa. This implies that we must not assume that an object is a certain way just because we see it a certain way.\n\nThe second implication is that we must not assume that an object is a certain way just because we know a certain amount of information about it.",
    "In the past few years, the debate on online education has been hotly contested. Many people believe that attending and completing online courses at home is beneficial for students, while others disagree with this opinion. In my opinion, this type of education has many advantages and disadvantages, but the main advantage is that it helps students learn at their own pace, while the main disadvantage is that it is difficult to interact with other students.\n\nFirstly, in my opinion, online courses are beneficial for students. The main advantage of this type of education is that it helps students learn at their own pace. This means that students can go at their own speed, and when they don\u2019t understand something, they can ask for help. This is a great advantage as it means that students can learn at a pace that suits them, and they are not forced to learn at a speed that they may not be comfortable with. This is extremely beneficial for students who have learning difficulties, as it means that they can learn at a speed that suits them. Secondly, online courses are beneficial because they are very convenient. This means that students can complete their courses at home, without having to travel to school or college. This is a great advantage for students, as it means that they don\u2019t have to waste time travelling to school or college, and can spend more time on their studies. Finally, online courses are beneficial because they are extremely flexible. This means that students can complete their courses at any time, and at any place. This is a great advantage for students, as it means that they can complete their courses whenever they want, and wherever they want. Thus, it is clear that online courses are beneficial for students, as they help them learn at their own pace, are convenient, and are flexible.\n\nHowever, online courses do have disadvantages. The main disadvantage of this type of education is that it is difficult to interact with other students. This means that students cannot talk to other students, and interact with them. This is a disadvantage, as it means that students cannot learn from other students, which is an extremely important part of the education system. The second disadvantage of online courses is that they are not effective. This means that students cannot learn effectively, as they are not interacting with other students. This is a disadvantage, as it means that students cannot learn effectively, as they are not interacting with other students. The third disadvantage of online courses is that they are expensive. This means that students cannot afford to complete online courses, and are therefore unable to learn effectively. This is a disadvantage, as it means that students cannot learn effectively, as they are not interacting with other students.\n\nIn conclusion, online courses are beneficial for students, but they do have disadvantages. The main advantage of online courses is that they help students learn at their own pace, while the main disadvantage is that it is difficult to interact with other students.\n\nI hope you find the essay useful.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nStudent\u2019s name\n\nStudent ID: 123456\n\nThis is a sample of an IELTS task 1 letter with a band score of 7.5.

    "The United States has a huge population of 311 million people, and this number is increasing at a rapid rate. In order to govern this country, the people of the United States have adopted a two-party system. The two parties are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, which represent the two major ideologies of the country. In order to ensure that the right person is elected as the president of the country, the United States has adopted an electoral college system. This system is a method of choosing the president by electing the members of the electoral college. The members of this college are selected by the citizens of the country through the primary elections. The electoral college system has been adopted by the country in order to prevent the abuse of power by the president and the government. The electoral college system has been in use since 1789, and it has been working well in the country. The electoral college system has been criticized for several reasons, and the most prominent criticism is that the electoral college system does not reflect the true will of the people.

    "Online classes have become increasingly popular in the last few years. This practice offers many benefits to students who have access to a computer. Additionally, it also benefits the parents who work and the teachers who can communicate with students without being physically present. However, online classes also have their share of challenges, as students may not have access to the internet at home and teachers may not be able to teach effectively without being present. The benefits of online classes are many. Students can attend classes from home and do not have to travel to the college. This saves time and money. Additionally, students who have a family or work commitments can attend classes at a time convenient to them. For example, if a student has a job from 9 to 5, he or she can attend classes in the evening. This will enable the student to complete his or her education without having to quit his or her job. Furthermore, students who do not have a computer at home can attend classes at a library or an internet cafe. This gives them an opportunity to pursue their education. Moreover, if students have a computer at home, they can study at their own pace and attend classes as per their convenience. On the other hand, online classes also have their share of challenges.

    "The Electoral College System of the United States is a unique system of voting. It was created by the Founding Fathers to prevent the election of an unqualified President. The Electoral College System is a system of indirect election in which the voters vote for an elector who is pledged to vote for a particular candidate. The Electoral College System has two advantages. First, it is democratic because the voters choose the President. Second, it is not democratic because the voters do not directly choose the President.

    "Distance learning is a concept that allows students to follow a course of study from home, via online or video conferencing. This allows students to avoid long commutes to attend classes and provides an opportunity for students to interact with teachers, without having to be physically present in the classroom. This essay will discuss the benefits of offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.\n\nThe most obvious benefit of distance learning is that it eliminates the need for students to travel to and from school. This negates the time wasted in travelling to and from school, thus allowing students to use this time for more useful purposes. For example, students who are not regular in attending school due to issues with transportation can use the time saved to follow their lessons from home and not fall behind in their studies. This is also useful for those students who require one-on-one interaction with a teacher, but are unable to travel to school due to health issues, such as asthma or other respiratory conditions, which make it difficult for them to breathe in smoky or dusty environments. It also helps students who live a long distance from the school, as they can still attend classes without having to travel long distances.\n\nDistance learning provides students with another opportunity to learn and interact with their teachers. Students who require one-on-one interaction with their teachers are able to do so via distance learning, thus allowing them to improve their performance in the classroom. Students can also be tutored via online or video conferencing, which allows teachers and students to interact from their own homes, without having to meet in person. This is helpful for students who require additional help with their studies, as they can receive the assistance they need, without having to travel to and from school.\n\nIn conclusion, distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home, via online or video conferencing. It provides students with an opportunity to learn and interact with their teachers, without having to travel to and from school. This is beneficial for students who face issues with transportation, health, and distance, as well as those who require one-on-one interaction with teachers.\n\n(418 words)\n\nI look forward to your feedback.\n\nThank you\n\nShirley\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Sep 23, 2019\n\nRe: Essay - Distance Learning\n\nHello Shirley!

    "I believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed because they help the students to prepare mentally for school, help the teachers to judge the student's capabilities, and help the students to develop a positive attitude towards school.\n\nFirstly, summer projects help the students to prepare mentally for school. As we all know, school is a place where students learn a lot of new things. But if students don't do summer projects, they will forget a lot of things that they have learned in the previous year and they will have to start from the very beginning. Therefore, summer projects are very important.\n\nSecondly, summer projects help the teachers to judge the student's capabilities. Teachers can easily judge students' capabilities through summer projects. They can see how much a student has understood the previous year's lesson and how much he/she has forgotten.\n\nThirdly, summer projects help the students to develop a positive attitude towards school. If students do summer projects, they will be mentally prepared for school and they will be excited to go to school. But if students don't do summer projects, they will have to start from the very beginning in the new school year, which will not only slow down their studies but will also make them lose interest in school, which will have a negative impact on their studies.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed because they help the students to prepare mentally for school, help the teachers to judge the student's capabilities, and help the students to develop a positive attitude towards school.\n\nThank you.\n\n#2\nI am writing the essay for the first time, so please correct my mistakes.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n#3\nI am writing the essay for the first time, so please correct my mistakes.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nVery good essay, and very good structure.

    "As you know, the Electoral College is the organization that formally elects the president and the vice president of the United States. The Electoral College is composed of 538 electors who cast the final ballot for the president and vice president. The number of electors is equal to the number of Senators (two each) and Representatives (435) in Congress, plus three for the District of Columbia. In addition, each state has one vote for each of its Senators and one for each of its Representatives. To become president, a candidate must receive a majority of the electoral votes, or 270 votes.

    "The advent of driverless cars will have a significant impact on the current transportation systems. However, there are some drawbacks to this new technology. This essay will focus on the three main drawbacks of driverless cars, namely, their lack of complete autonomy, inconvenience, and safety concerns.\n\nTo begin with, the most significant drawback of driverless cars is that they are not completely autonomous. It may be argued that the current level of technology does not allow for autonomous driving, and that driverless cars should not be used on public roads. However, the technology is advancing rapidly, and the next generation of driverless cars will be able to drive by themselves. For example, Google's self-driving car is already on the market. Moreover, there are many other companies that are working on developing driverless cars. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that driverless cars will be fully autonomous in the near future.\n\nSecondly, the convenience of driverless cars is questionable. The main reason for this is that driverless cars are too expensive. For example, an average driverless car costs $100,000. On the other hand, a traditional car costs only $25,000. Therefore, if people are going to buy driverless cars, they will have to spend a lot of money. Moreover, the cost of driverless cars will go up as more people buy them. This means that only the wealthy people will be able to afford them. Furthermore, the cost of driverless cars will increase as more people buy them. This means that only the wealthy people will be able to afford them.\n\nFinally, there are safety concerns associated with driverless cars. For example, there are many drivers who are not very skilled. They may cause accidents if they are driving a driverless car. Moreover, there are some drivers who are not very skilled. They may cause accidents if they are driving a driverless car. Moreover, there are some drivers who are not very skilled. They may cause accidents if they are driving a driverless car. Moreover, there are some drivers who are not very skilled. They may cause accidents if they are driving a driverless car.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many drawbacks to driverless cars.

    "The rapid developments in technology and science have led to the creation of numerous inventions, which have made our lives easier and more convenient. One of the most popular inventions is driverless cars, which have been increasingly used over the past few years. These cars have many benefits that make them attractive to consumers and I believe that they should be developed and used in the future.\n\nDriverless cars have many advantages. For instance, they are more convenient than normal cars, as they do not require any driver. People can arrive at their destination simply by sitting inside the car and pressing a button. However, they are not only convenient, but also safe. The driverless cars have a GPS system, which enables them to find the shortest and most convenient route to the destination. This makes them much safer than normal cars, as they do not get lost and do not need to depend on a driver's driving skills. In addition, they are also eco-friendly, as they do not emit any harmful gases into the environment. Therefore, driverless cars can be used by everyone, including children and older people.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some disadvantages to driverless cars. First of all, they are very expensive, as they require a lot of money to be manufactured. Secondly, they do not have any backup system, which means that they can stop working at any time. This means that they can also be dangerous, as they can cause traffic accidents.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that driverless cars should be used and developed in the future, as they are more convenient and safe than normal cars. However, they are very expensive and could be dangerous if they stop working.\n\nThanks for your effort and I will appreciate your kind response.\n\nSincerely,\nKumar\n\nEdited by Kumar_1967 on 29/03/2018 at 06:06\n28/03/2018 16:57:33\n# 2\nmanojkumar\nPosts: 1\nJoined: 10/02/2018\nReputation: 0\nLocation: India\nHi Kumar,\n\nI have edited your essay below.

For instance, they are more convenient than normal cars, as they do not require any driver. People can arrive at their destination simply by sitting inside the car and pressing a button. However, they are not only convenient, but also safe. The driverless cars have a GPS system, which enables them to find the shortest and most convenient route to the destination. This makes them much safer than normal cars, as they do not get lost and do not need to depend on a driver's driving skills. In addition, they are also eco-friendly, as they do not emit any harmful gases into the environment. Therefore, driverless cars can be used by everyone,",
    "In the recent years, the technology has advanced to a level where we can expect driverless cars to be on the roads in the near future. This technology has both positive and negative implications for the society.\nOn the one hand, driverless cars can bring about many advantages to society. For example, it will reduce the number of accidents on the roads and thus save a lot of lives. It will also reduce the road congestion and thus, help people reach their destination on time. Moreover, the driverless cars will save the fuel consumption, which will result in a better environment. On the other hand, there are some negative implications of this new technology. For example, it will lead to job losses, as people will lose their jobs in the transportation industry. This will eventually cause a reduction in the number of drivers on the roads, which will lead to an increase in the number of accidents.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the driverless cars should be further developed and implemented, as they will bring many positive changes to society.\n\nTOEFL listening discussions: [A conversation between two students in an English class](english.best/toefl/exercise/a-...)\n\n",
    "It would be beneficial for the United States to limit the number of cars on the road. \nThis would lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a less stressful and safer society, and a cleaner environment. \n\nFirst, limiting car usage would cut down on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by automobiles. \nIn 2017, the United States produced 6,673 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. \nThis is equivalent to 15.3 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person. \nIf the U.S. were to limit traffic, the country could significantly lower its emissions. \nIn 2010, 75 percent of the world's cities had more than 3 million inhabitants, and 60 percent had more than 5 million. \nIn cities such as Paris, France, and Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, the government has limited the number of cars allowed on the road on certain days, depending on their license plate numbers. \nThis has led to a reduction in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. \nParis, for example, saw a 40 percent reduction in pollution levels. \nIn addition, the amount of nitrogen dioxide in the air decreased by 45 percent and the amount of particles in the air decreased by 16 percent. \n\nSecond, limiting car usage would make driving less stressful and safer for drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. \nIn 2016, 37,461 people were killed in traffic accidents in the United States, which is an average of 102 per day. \nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1.7 million people were injured in traffic accidents in the same year. \nIn addition, the majority of traffic accidents are caused by driver error, such as speeding, failure to yield, and distracted driving. \nIn 2015, 94 percent of traffic accidents in the United States were caused by human error. \nIf the number of cars on the road were reduced, traffic accidents and fatalities would decline, which would reduce stress for drivers and make the roads safer. \n\nThird, limiting car usage would improve the environment's atmosphere. \nIn 2015, the United States emitted 6,683 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. \nThis is equivalent to 14.8 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person. \nIn addition, the U.S. had 243.9 million registered vehicles in 2015, which is the highest number of registered vehicles in the world. \nIf the U.S. were to limit car usage, the country could significantly reduce its carbon dioxide emissions. \nIn 2015, the United States emitted 6,683 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. \nThis is equivalent to 14.8 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person. \nIn addition, the U.S. had 243.9 million registered vehicles in 2015, which is the highest number of registered vehicles in the world. \nIf the U.S. were to limit car usage, the country could significantly reduce its",

    "When making decisions, people tend to seek advice from many different sources. It is important to seek advice from multiple sources because it helps people to make better decisions. This can be clearly seen from personal experience and hypothetical scenarios.\n\nTo begin with, seeking advice from multiple sources helps people to make better decisions. For example, in my experience, I did not have enough information about my studies in the United States. I decided to go to the local library and read about the United States. I also decided to consult my friends who had studied in the United States to get more information about the United States. I also decided to consult my parents to get more information about the United States. Finally, I decided to go online and read about the United States.

    "Even though Venus is the closest planet to Earth, it is too hot for human habitation. However, in the past, there have been attempts to colonize Venus with the help of robots. For example, NASA has plans to send a probe to Venus in 2025, which will be the first mission in which humans will explore the planet. I believe that we should also send humans to Venus to colonize it. There are various reasons for this. First, Venus is the closest planet to Earth, so it is easy to travel to Venus from Earth. Second, the atmosphere of Venus is suitable for human life, which makes it easy to live there. Third, the temperature on Venus is cooler than it is on Earth, which makes it more habitable. Fourth, Venus is a barren planet, which means that there is no competition for resources. Fifth, there is a constant supply of food and water because of the atmosphere of Venus, which makes it easy to live there. Sixth, the temperature on Venus is cooler than it is on Earth, which makes it more habitable. Seventh, Venus is a barren planet, which means that there is no competition for resources.

    "In the fast and fierce competition of the 21st century, it is becoming increasingly difficult to succeed in life. As a result, it is necessary to start preparing for the struggle from childhood. Extracurricular activities play a significant role in this process. They have a positive impact on the development of children in various aspects: building friendships, acquiring special skills, and building confidence.\n\nThe first positive aspect of extracurricular activities is that they help children to build friendships. For example, in the USA, the percentage of people who have never had a friend is 25%. In this situation, extracurricular activities provide a great opportunity to make new friends. In addition, they often bring together children of the same age and interests. For example, a child who likes to play basketball will always find companions in a basketball club, who share the same passion. This is a great opportunity to make friends who will share the same interests.\n\nThe second positive aspect of extracurricular activities is that they help children to acquire special skills. For example, learning a foreign language is much more difficult in a classroom than in a language club. In addition, children who participate in sports teams are more likely to be healthy and strong. They also learn to manage stress and time more effectively, which is very important in the modern world.\n\nThe last positive aspect of extracurricular activities is that they help children to build confidence. For example, a child who takes part in a theatre club will not be afraid to speak in public. In addition, a child who learns to play a musical instrument will gain confidence in his or her abilities. As a result, he or she will be more likely to succeed in life.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that extracurricular activities are important for the development of children. They help to build friendships, acquire special skills, and build confidence. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage children to participate in such activities.\n\nI hope you will like my essay.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n",
    "With the increasing importance of academic studies in today's world, extracurricular activities are becoming less important in students' lives. I believe that extracurricular activities are still essential for students in many ways, including their social benefits, the development of new skills, and the opportunity to take a break from school. \n\nFirst and foremost, extracurricular activities provide students with the opportunity to socialize and make new friends. As students spend most of their time in school, they rarely get the chance to socialize outside school. If students participate in extracurricular activities, they can get to know their peers and classmates in a different environment. In addition, extracurricular activities help students build new skills. For example, students who participate in sports activities can develop their leadership and teamworking skills. Moreover, extracurricular activities give students the opportunity to take a break from school. Students who participate in extracurricular activities learn to manage their time and prioritize their tasks. \n\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities are still essential for students' lives. They provide students with the opportunity to socialize and make new friends, the chance to develop new skills, and the opportunity to take a break from school.\n\nThank you very much for your time and consideration.

    "In today's world, choosing a topic for a project based on one's interest and curiosity has become a trend. The students are encouraged by the teachers to select a topic for the project based on their interests. The teacher's role is to guide the students in their project and to supervise them to achieve the desired results.\n\nIn my opinion, it is true that the students can achieve better results if they are allowed to choose their own project. There are many reasons behind this. The following are a few of them.\n\nFirst, the students will be able to choose a topic of their interest. Thus, they will be devoted to the project. This will allow them to spend more time on the project and hence, they will be able to achieve better results. The students will also be able to choose a topic that is relevant to them. For example, if the students are interested in economics, they can choose a topic on economics. This will allow them to understand their project better.

    "I believe that participating in after school clubs and activities provides numerous benefits for students who are struggling in certain subjects or looking to join a new club.\n\nFirst of all, by participating in after school clubs and activities, students are able to spend more time with their peers and teachers. This allows them to become more comfortable and familiar with their teachers and classmates, which can lead to better grades. For example, A student who is struggling in a certain subject, such as Math, can join the Math club and be able to work with peers who are also struggling in Math, which can help the student feel more comfortable in the subject. Secondly, participating in after school clubs and activities may help students who are looking to join a new club. For example, a student who is looking to join a new club, such as a theatre club, can join the drama club after school, which helps the student join the theatre club.

    "Society has always been driven by the necessity of solving problems. The most efficient way to deal with them is it to take advice from multiple sources, for example, friends, family and experts. This essay will discuss the benefits of this approach and use examples to justify the statement.\n\nThe first and most important benefit is that the person who needs advice will get a more comprehensive and balanced point of view, which is essential for making a better decision. For example, if a person needs to choose a career path, it is a good idea to get advice from various sources, such as their parents, friends and a professional career advisor. This will give them a better perspective and help them make better decisions.\n\nAnother advantage is that they will be able to learn from others\u2019 mistakes. For example, if a friend of a person is going through a divorce, the person can take advice from this person on how to avoid making the same mistakes. This way, the person will be able to make better decisions and avoid the same mistakes.\n\nHowever, there are certain disadvantages to taking advice from multiple sources. First of all, it is possible that the person will receive conflicting advice. For instance, if a person is seeking advice from a friend, a parent and a professional, the person will receive three different pieces of advice, which may not always be in his best interest. Another disadvantage is that the person will have to consider too many options, which may be overwhelming. For example, a person may be seeking advice on how to raise a child, which may be too much.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that taking advice from multiple sources is beneficial. However, this approach has some disadvantages as well. Therefore, it is a good idea to consider the advantages and disadvantages of this approach before making a decision.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that taking advice from multiple sources is beneficial.

    "The article \"Venus: The Planet of Danger\" by James L. Green and David Grinspoon presents the reasons why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the potential dangers. I will first explain why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit and then evaluate the author's argument for supporting this idea.\n\nThe main purpose of studying Venus is to understand the evolution of the Earth and the Solar System. Venus is the closest planet to Earth, and it is the only planet in our solar system that shares the same orbital distance with Earth. Therefore, Venus can be used as a model to understand the evolution of Earth. The article explains that Venus and Earth have similar size, mass, and density. However, Venus is now a barren wasteland while Earth is a planet with abundant life. The article explains that Venus became a barren wasteland due to the greenhouse effect caused by the dense atmosphere. The article explains that the greenhouse effect is caused by the presence of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide in Venus's atmosphere. These gases absorb heat from the Sun and trap it on the planet, causing the surface to heat up. This led to the transformation of surface water into steam and the removal of the water vapor from the atmosphere. This led to the transformation of surface water into steam and the removal of the water vapor from the atmosphere. This led to the transformation of surface water into steam and the removal of the water vapor from the atmosphere. This led to the transformation of surface water into steam and the removal of the water vapor from the atmosphere.

This led to the transformation of surface water into steam and the removal of the water vapor from the atmosphere. This led to the transformation of surface water into steam and the removal of the water vapor from the atmosphere.\n\nThe author also argues that studying Venus will help us understand how to prevent Venus from becoming a barren wasteland like it is now. The author explains that the greenhouse effect caused by the dense atmosphere is the main reason for Venus's barren wasteland.

    "Community service has a great impact on the community as it provides the community with help it needs. It also has a great impact on the individual as it teaches them to become self-reliant. Nevertheless, community service has some drawbacks. This essay will discuss both the positives and negatives of community service.\n\nA great benefit of community service is that it helps the community. When a person performs community service, he/she helps the community by doing things such as cleaning the streets and helping the elderly. Community service also helps the community by improving the living conditions of the community. For example, if a neighborhood has a lot of trash on the streets, then the neighborhood will not look good and it will also decrease the value of the houses and the neighborhood. If the neighborhood has a lot of trash on the street, then the volunteers can go to the neighborhood and clean the streets. This will help the neighborhood and it will also make the volunteers feel good about themselves.\n\nThe other benefit of community service is that it teaches the individual to become self-reliant. For example, if a person performs community service, then he/she will learn to rely on himself/herself. This is because they will not have any help from other people when they perform community service. They will have to rely on themselves and their own skills. This will make them feel good about themselves and it will also help them become self-reliant.\n\nThe last benefit of community service is that it helps the individual become more responsible. For example, if a person performs community service, then he/she will learn to take responsibility for their actions. This is because they will have to take responsibility for the work that they do when they perform community service. This will make them feel good about themselves and it will also help them become more responsible.\n\nThe other negative aspect of community service is that it can be difficult for the individual. For example, if a person performs community service, then he/she will have to learn to overcome challenges that they will face. This is because they will have to face challenges while performing community service. This can be difficult for the individual because they will not have any help from other people when they perform community service. They will have to rely on themselves and their own skills. This can be difficult for the individual because they will not have any",
    "Community is a group of people living together in a particular area. Community service is an activity that provides service to a community. It is a form of volunteering. Community service is important to the United States. It helps to build a strong community. It also helps us to develop a sense of responsibility towards the community. Many community services are available for people. These include, but are not limited to, community centres, homeless shelters, schools and hospitals. Some of these places rely on volunteers to do the work. It is important for us to volunteer in these places because without volunteers, these places would not be able to function. For example, if there were no volunteers, the homeless shelters would not be able to provide for the homeless. Community service can change a person's character. It can make a person's character more responsible. For example, if a person volunteers at a homeless shelter, he or she will learn that he or she must be responsible towards the community and the people in the community. Mandatory community service has many benefits for students and the community. It can help students to develop a sense of responsibility towards the community. It can also help students to develop a sense of responsibility towards their",
    "Seeking advice from multiple sources is not only beneficial but also essential in order to make a sound decision. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of seeking advice from multiple sources and provide examples of different types of people one could seek advice from and how their perspectives could be helpful.\n\nThe first benefit of seeking advice from multiple sources is that you will get different perspectives and points of view. This will allow you to consider all possibilities and alternatives, and this will help you to make a more informed decision. For example, a person is considering taking a new job in a different city. He already has a job offer from a company, and he is very interested in working for them. However, he is not sure if he should accept this job offer because he has also received a job offer from another company, and he is also very interested in working for them. He does not know which job offer to accept. In this situation, he could seek advice from his family and friends, and they could give him their opinion on which job offer to accept. This would allow him to consider all possible alternatives and make a more informed decision. Another benefit of seeking advice from multiple sources is that you will get different perspectives and points of view.

    "The Electoral College is the method used to elect the President of the United States. It was constructed by the founding fathers as a compromise between electing the president by a vote in Congress and a national popular vote. The Electoral College is comprised of 538 electors, and an absolute majority of 270 votes is required to win the election. Currently, in the United States, the president is elected by the Electoral College, but the question of whether it is the best method to elect the president is controversial. This essay will argue the pros and cons of the Electoral College and whether it should be abolished and replaced with a popular vote system or kept in place.\n\nThe Electoral College system is inefficient and often leads to a winner-take-all system that is not representative of the popular vote. The Electoral College is designed to elect the president of the United States, but it also disenfranchises voters in the United States. The Electoral College system is outdated, and it was implemented more than two centuries ago. The Electoral College system is not representative of the popular vote and it is not a fair representation of the American people. For example, in the 2000 presidential election, Al Gore won the popular vote but George W. Bush won the Electoral College. This was because in Florida, a key state, there was a recount, and Bush's margin of victory was less than one percent. This means that the Electoral College is not a fair representation of the American people because the Electoral College system is not representative of the popular vote.\n\nThe Electoral College system is also inefficient and often leads to a winner-take-all system that is not representative of the popular vote.

    "Having a phone is a common thing nowadays. It's just like having a friend, someone who you can always talk to whenever you want. But, what if this friend becomes a burden? What if this friend is a distraction? Many people don't like the idea of having a phone in the classroom, but I think that it's a good idea, because phones can be very useful.\n\nFirst of all, phones can be very useful during a school day. For example, if there is a fire, the principal can send a message to all students' phones to tell them to evacuate the building. Also, if a student gets sick, his or her friends can send a message to the student's parents to tell them that their child is sick. This is very important, especially in an emergency. Furthermore, sometimes the school may have a change in schedule or a cancellation of an event. In this case, students can receive messages from the school informing them about this change or cancellation.\n\nOn the other hand, some people say that phones are a distraction during school hours. I disagree with this idea because phones can be very useful even during classes. For example, if a student is absent from school, he or she can ask the teacher a question about the homework. Also, if a student has a problem with a classmate, he or she can send a text message to the teacher and ask for help. In addition, students can text their friends, if they are bored in class. So, having a phone in the classroom can be very useful.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, I strongly believe that phones should be allowed in the classroom. Not only",
    "The face on Mars is a controversial topic in the field of science. The controversy has been brewing for a long time, and it is still ongoing. For many years, it was believed that the face on Mars was a natural landform, but now many scientists believe that it is an artifact left behind by past civilizations on Mars. I will discuss the controversy surrounding the face on Mars, and the evidence supporting the argument that it is a naturally occurring landform.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the face on Mars began when the Viking 1 spacecraft took photographs of the face on Mars. The face on Mars is a huge rock formation in the Cydonia region of Mars. When the images were first published, many scientists believed that it was a natural landform, but then, as more images were released, many scientists began to believe that it was an artifact left behind by past civilizations on Mars.\n\nThere are several reasons why many scientists believe that the face on Mars is a naturally occurring landform. First of all, the face on Mars is a very large rock formation. It is so large that it can be seen from space. Second, the face on Mars is not symmetrical. It is shaped like a face, but it does not have any eyes or nose. Third, the face on Mars is not perfectly round. It is more like a skull than a face. Fourth, the face on Mars is not perfectly flat. It is shaped like a skull, but it is not perfectly flat. Fifth, the face on Mars is not perfectly symmetrical. It is shaped like a skull, but it is not perfectly symmetrical.

    "In the United States, the presidential elections are decided by the winner of the election being the candidate who receives the majority of the votes. The system is known as the \"election by popular vote\" system. In contrast, the system used in the United States presidential elections is called the \"electoral college\" system. The electoral college is a system used to elect the president and vice president of the United States. The system works by electors from each state casting their vote for the president and vice president respectively.

    "The future is here. Self-driving cars are already a reality, and the technology is improving every day. While the benefits of driverless cars are many, the risks are equally as great. The development and implementation of this technology should be approached with caution, as it has the potential to cause a multitude of problems. One of the biggest risks associated with driverless cars is the potential for technological malfunctions. While these cars will be monitored and controlled by computers, computers are not infallible. While the technology is becoming increasingly more advanced and reliable, the possibility of a malfunction is still there. If a malfunction were to occur, it could cause devastating results. Another risk associated with driverless cars is the potential for human error. While the cars are controlled by computers, the computers are controlled by humans. If the person programming the car were to make a mistake, it could result in the car malfunctioning. Similarly, if the person monitoring the car were to make a mistake, it could result in the car malfunctioning. The third risk is one that is difficult to quantify. When driverless cars are involved in accidents, assigning blame is going to be difficult. If the car malfunctioned, is the driver to blame? If the driver made a mistake, is the company that produced the car to blame? If the person monitoring the car made a mistake, is the company that created the technology to blame? All of these questions are going to be difficult to answer, and could lead to multiple lawsuits. While there are many benefits to the development and implementation of driverless cars, there are also many risks. These risks need to be addressed and mitigated before the technology is ready to be released to the public.\n\nOP: Thank you very much. I will look into the feedback you have given me. I will try to incorporate it into my essay. \n",
    "The use of cell phones while driving is a growing cause of accidents. This is because it diverts the driver's attention from the road ahead. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, the use of cell phones while driving is a factor in 26 percent of all accidents. Additionally, 20 percent of all traffic fatalities in the country are caused by distracted driving, which includes the use of cell phones while driving.\n\nThe dangers of using cell phones while driving are many. A recent study by the American Automobile Association showed that drivers who use cell phones while driving are 4 times more likely to be in an accident. The study also showed that a driver who uses a cell phone while driving is 8 times more likely to get into an accident than a driver who is not using a cell phone.\n\nThe reasons why people continue to use cell phones while driving are many. Some people use cell phones while driving because they believe that they are able to use them safely. Others believe that the use of cell phones while driving is not dangerous. However, others believe that the use of cell phones while driving is not dangerous because it is not illegal to use cell phones while driving.\n\nThere are many ways to reduce the dangers of using cell phones while driving. For example, hands-free devices have been proven to reduce the number of accidents caused by cell phone use while driving. Additionally, some states have passed laws that make it illegal",
    "Today\u2019s world is full of opportunities, but it is also full of problems. It is so easy to make a wrong decision and end up in a difficult situation. In order to create a good decision, we need to make use of our common sense and experience, but we should also seek the help of others. We should listen to what other people have to say and take into consideration their opinion. This will help us to limit our own bias and see the problem from different perspectives. In this essay, I will explain the importance of seeking multiple opinions and how it can help limit our own bias. I will also explain how biased opinions can lead to negative consequences, and how obtaining wisdom from others can guide individuals towards making better choices.\n\nFirstly, in order to make a good decision, we need to think smart. This means that we should make use of our common sense and experience, but also listen to what other people have to say. As human beings, we are not perfect and we have a tendency to be biased. If we do not seek the help of others, it is easy for us to end up in a difficult situation.\n\nSecondly, if we do not seek the help of others, we can end up making a wrong decision. This is because we are all biased. For example, if I was asked to make a decision on whether or not to spend money on a new pair of shoes, I would think of the benefits of buying the shoes and come to the conclusion that it would be a good idea to spend money on them. However, if I listened to what other people had to say, they would probably tell me that it is a bad idea to spend money on a new pair of shoes. This would help me see the situation from different perspectives. In this example, I would be guided towards making a better decision.\n\nFinally, if we do not seek the help of others, we can end up in a difficult situation. For example, if I did not listen to what other people had to say, I would probably end up spending money on a new pair of shoes. This would lead to negative consequences. For example, I would be spending money on a new pair of shoes when I could be spending it on something else. This would not be good for my finances. In this example, I would be guided towards making a better decision.\n\nIn conclusion, in order to make a good decision, we need to think smart. We should make use of our common sense and experience, but also listen to what other people have to say. This will help us to limit our own bias and see the problem from different perspectives.

    "The author believes that the exploration of Venus is not worth the risk. This is because the planet is extremely hot and its atmosphere is so dense that a human would suffocate within seconds of stepping on the surface. Furthermore, the gravity of Venus is 91% of that of Earth. Since Venus is also the closest planet to Earth, the author believes that we should explore it first. The author considers the possibility of a manned mission to Venus in the future, but he notes that it would be very difficult, relying on a nuclear-powered rocket for propulsion. This rocket would be so large that it would have to be launched from a planet other than Earth. The author also notes that the Venusian surface is extremely hot and that a spacecraft that could survive the trip would be so large that it would be difficult to launch. Finally, the author notes that Venus is not the only planet that we can learn from. He points out that we already have a spacecraft at Venus, and that the Venusian surface is not as interesting as Mars. The author believes that we should explore Mars first, since it is the most similar to Earth, and because we can learn more about the planet and its atmosphere from orbiting it.\n\nI also request you to correct the grammatical errors.\n\nThanks.\n\nshare|improve this question\n\nedited Sep 29 '12 at 7:53\n\nasked Sep 29 '12 at 6:43\n\nOxwivi\n4,2412285152\n\n1   \n\nI suppose it's a homework?

    "Car usage has increased rapidly over the last few years, especially in urban areas. However, this has led to severe problems, such as road accidents and pollution. In this essay I will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage, including the potential reduction of accidents and pollution. I will also consider the potential benefits of alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit.\n\nAs mentioned above, car usage has risen significantly in recent years. This is due to a number of reasons, including the fact that cars are becoming more affordable and the fact that the public transport systems in major cities are inadequate. When cars are used excessively, they lead to several problems, including accidents, pollution and traffic congestion. Thus, it is important to limit car usage.\n\nOne of the most important benefits of limiting car usage is that it can reduce the number of road accidents. For example, in Freiburg, Germany, the number of accidents decreased by 25% after the city implemented a ban on car usage in certain areas. This is because cars are often involved in accidents, and when they are not used, fewer accidents occur. In addition, if cars are not used, there will be fewer cars on the road, which means that traffic jams will be less common.\n\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is that it can reduce the amount of pollution. For example, in Paris, France, the number of cars decreased by 80% after the city implemented a ban on car usage in certain areas. This is because cars emit pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, which contribute to air pollution. In addition, when cars are not used, there will be fewer cars on the road, which means that pollution will be less common.\n\nThe last advantage of limiting car usage is that it can reduce traffic congestion. For example, in Paris, France, the number of cars decreased by 80% after the city implemented a ban on car usage in certain areas. This is because when cars are not used, there will be fewer cars on the road, which means that traffic jams will be less common.\n\nOne of the potential benefits of limiting car usage is that it can benefit individuals and communities. For example, in Freiburg, Germany, the number of accidents decreased by 25% after the city implemented a ban on car usage in certain areas. This is because when cars are not used, there will be fewer cars on the road, which means that traffic jams will be less common. In addition, limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion, which means that people will have more time to spend with their families.

    "Although the number of students who take classes online from home is increasing, the potential benefits of this alternative method of learning are not always the same as those of the conventional learning environments. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss the potential benefits of taking classes online from home for students who struggle with fitting in or experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety in public schools. I will also discuss the potential drawbacks of isolation and lack of communication skills.\n\nTo begin with, one of the potential benefits of taking classes online from home is that students who struggle with fitting in or experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety in public schools can increase their focus and concentration. For example, students who are bullied in school may feel relieved or more comfortable when they can learn at home. In addition, students who have social anxiety may feel more comfortable learning at home.\n\nMoreover, another potential benefit of taking classes online from home is that students can work more efficiently and effectively, which may lead to better mental health. For instance, students who are bullied in school may suffer from depression, which may lead to poor academic performance. However, taking classes online from home may help them to avoid the stress they feel in public schools, which may help them to work more efficiently and effectively.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the potential drawbacks of taking classes online from home is that students may become isolated and lack communication skills. For example, students who are shy may have difficulty communicating with their teachers or classmates online. Also, students who are bullied in school may feel more isolated and lack communication skills when they take classes online from home.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential benefits of taking classes online from home for students who struggle with fitting in or experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety in public schools are increased focus and concentration, better mental health, and the potential drawbacks of isolation and lack of communication skills. However, the potential drawbacks of isolation and lack of communication skills are potential drawbacks of taking classes online from home.\n\nMagoosh Test Prep\n\nRelated Posts\n\n- IELTS Writing Task 2: \u2018online learning\u2019 Topic\n- IELTS Writing Task 2: \u2018countryside\u2019 Topic\n- IELTS Writing Task 2: \u2018traditional values\u2019 Topic\n- IELTS Writing Task 2: \u2018university education\u2019 Topic\n- IELTS Writing Task 2: \u2018university education\u2019 Topic\n- IELTS Writing Task 2: \u2018modern life\u2019 Topic\n\nWritten by Magoosh Test Prep\n\nMagoosh Test Prep provides expert private test prep for SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, and more.

    "Venus is a planet that is situated in the solar system, and it is the second closest planet to the sun. The planet is commonly known as the \u201cEarth\u2019s twin\u201d, because it is similar to the Earth in terms of mass and temperature. In the recent past, scientists have been increasingly interested in research concerning the possibilities of life on Venus. The possibility of life on Venus is a controversial issue, and the scientists have different opinions regarding the matter. The scientists have used various methods to search for life on Venus. The most common method that has been used is the use of the radio spectrum. The radio spectrum is a method that has been used for a long time to search for life on other planets.

    "When we are faced with a problem and we don\u2019t know how to solve it, we should try to ask for advice from other people. Asking for someone else's advice can lead to making better decisions and understanding different perspectives. Nowadays, we are living in a world where we can get access to the internet and all the information we are looking for. But, even if we can have access to all the information we need, we cannot know how to use it properly. Therefore, asking for advice from someone is the best choice. In the following, some reasons will be explained in detail.\n\nFirstly, when we are trying to solve a problem, we may not know how to use the information we have to solve it. For example, you want to buy a house, and you have the money to pay the down payment, but you do not know which house is the best for you. In this case, you should ask for some advice from someone you trust. If you ask your friend, he/she will give you some advice that is based on their own experiences.

    "The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The Founding Fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\n\nThe Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.\n\nFor example, California has 53 members in its Congressional delegation. California's allotment is 54 electors. California is guaranteed at least one elector for each member in its Congressional delegation. The remaining 53 electors are chosen by a statewide vote. California's 53 electors are voted on by the voters and pledged to each presidential candidate in proportion to that candidate's popular vote total.\n\nEach state holds its presidential election on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November in every fourth year. If a presidential candidate garners 270 or more electoral votes, he or she is elected President. If no candidate garners a majority of electoral votes, the House of Representatives elects the President from the three candidates who received the most",
    "The Face on Mars is a controversial site that has been the subject of much debate since it was first observed by the Viking 1 spacecraft in 1976. The appearance of the Martian landscape is remarkably similar to that of the Earth, with mountains, valleys and plains. However, the Face on Mars is a large-scale landform that is said to resemble a face, with a nose, eye sockets and a mouth. However, the argument for the face being a natural landform is supported by the NASA images that show the \"Face on Mars\" to be a natural landform.\n\nThe first image of the Face on Mars was taken by the Viking 1 orbiter in 1976.

    "I think that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the drawbacks in terms of safety, and environment protection. In this essay, I will discuss this view point and provide some evidence to support my opinion.\n\nFirst of all, there are several benefits of driverless cars. According to the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", driverless cars could reduce the number of traffic accidents. In the United States, the number of traffic accidents is increasing dramatically. In 2015, there were 35,092 fatal car accidents in the United States, which was an 8.1% increase from 2014 (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2016). The article also estimates that driverless cars could reduce the number of fatal car accidents by 90% (Driverless Cars Are Coming, 2016). Another benefit is that driverless cars could reduce the number of road congestion. According to the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", driverless cars could be programmed to reduce the number of traffic jams (Driverless Cars Are Coming, 2016). Also, the article estimates that driverless cars could save 4.2 billion hours of time wasted in traffic jams every year in the United States (Driverless Cars Are Coming, 2016). Finally, there are several environmental benefits of driverless cars. According to the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", driverless cars could reduce the number of carbon dioxide gas emissions (Driverless Cars Are Coming, 2016). The article also estimates that driverless cars could save 1.2 billion gallons of gasoline every year in the United States (Driverless Cars Are Coming, 2016).\n\nOn the other hand, there are some potential drawbacks of driverless cars. According to the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", driverless cars could cause a decrease in the number of jobs. The article estimates that driverless cars could cause an 8% decrease in the number of jobs in the United States (Driverless Cars Are Coming, 2016). Another drawback is that driverless cars could cause a decrease in the number of car sales. The article estimates that driverless cars could cause a 40% decrease in the number of car sales in the United States (Driverless Cars Are Coming, 2016). Finally, there are some privacy concerns. According to the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", driverless cars could collect a large amount of data about the passengers (Driverless Cars Are Coming, 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, there are several benefits and drawbacks of driverless cars.

    "The electoral college is an institution that was created to select the president and vice president of the United States. It was put in place by the founding fathers to make sure the US government was not based on a direct democracy but on a republic. The Electoral College system is a system of indirect democracy, which functions according to the principle of majority rule. It has been in use since 1789 and has been the subject of much criticism. The main criticism is that the Electoral College is not at all a democratic process. Even though the Electoral College has the power to elect the president, it is not democratic. It does not represent the will of the people. It is a system that was created by the founding fathers to protect the interests of the states and the people.\n\nHowever, the Electoral College has some advantages. It makes sure that the larger states are not overrepresented. It also makes sure that the smaller states are not underrepresented. It is the only institution that is able to check the power of the president. The Electoral College has the power to reject the president and choose another president. It also has the power to reject the vice president. It is the only institution that is able to reject the president and choose another president.\n\nThe Electoral College, in its present form, is not a democratic institution.

    "Teachers and students should be responsible for designing Summer projects. In my opinion, students should be responsible for designing Summer projects because students have more time to design project during Summer. Moreover, students will get more experience on designing project. However, teachers should be responsible for designing Summer projects because teachers have more experience on designing project. In addition, teachers can help students if they have any problem on designing project.\n\nFirstly, students should be responsible for designing Summer projects. The reason is that students have more time to design project. This is because students are on Summer vacation. Students can spend more time on designing project.

It is not only used in the classroom setting but also in other settings such as in facial recognition security systems and law enforcement agencies. However, there is a debate on its effectiveness in improving security systems and aiding law enforcement in identifying suspects. This essay will evaluate the potential uses of emotion detection technology beyond the classroom setting and analyze its effectiveness in improving facial recognition security systems and aiding law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects.

    "While it is true that students should not be permitted to participate in sports or other activities if they have a grade lower than a C, the reasons for such a policy are less clear. To assess the validity of the policy, it is important to consider its impact on the student, teacher, and athletic department.\n\nThe policy has a significant impact on the student as it forces them to devote more time to study. This puts the student under significant pressure, which might result in a decrease in their athletic performance. This is not desirable from the perspective of the athletic department, but it might not be a significant issue if the athletic department is able to compensate for the lost performance by recruiting other athletes. In this case, the policy has a negative impact on the student but it is acceptable from the perspective of the athletic department.\n\nThe policy has a positive impact on the teacher as it forces the students to give more attention to their studies.

    "The Electoral College is among the most controversial systems used to elect the president of the United States. This system is based on the idea that the president should be elected by the people and the state governments. The Electoral College system was established by the founding fathers of the United States and has been in force ever since. The Electoral College system is an indirect voting system that allows the people to vote for the electors in the electoral college, who in turn cast their votes for the president.\n\nThe Electoral College system has been criticized for being outdated and having several flaws. The main criticism of this system is that it is not based on the popular vote of the people. The Electoral College consists of a group of electors who have the sole responsibility of electing the president of the United States. The number of electors in each state is equal to the number of representatives that the state has in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The electors are chosen by the state governments of each state. The electors are usually chosen by the state governments of each state because most states do not allow direct voting for the electors.\n\nThere are several reasons why the Electoral College system is not based on the popular vote. One reason is that the Electoral College system does not give each state equal representation. The number of electors in each state is determined by the number of representatives and senators that the state has in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Each state has two senators and the number of representatives depends on the size of the state. The number of representatives in a state is based on the population of the state. Therefore, the smaller states have fewer representatives than the larger states. This means that the smaller states have fewer votes in the electoral college than the larger states.\n\nAnother reason why the Electoral College system is not based on the popular vote is that each state has a minimum number of electors. The number of electors in each state is equal to the number of representatives and senators that the state has in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The number of representatives and senators in each state is determined by the population of the state.

    "There is a landform on Mars that some people believe was created by aliens. This is highly unlikely because the landform has been formed by natural processes. Firstly, the landform is very similar to a crater. There are many craters on Mars that have been created by natural processes. In addition, the landform is located in a part of Mars that has been heavily eroded by wind, water and ice. This means that the landform is very old. Furthermore, the landform is located in a part of Mars where there are no signs of life. Aliens would need to be able to survive in the harsh environment of Mars and there is no evidence that aliens have done this.\n\nIn conclusion, the landform on Mars was almost certainly not created by aliens.

While some people would argue that grades are an incentive for students to study, others would say that they are the cause of stress and anxiety among students.

I believe that this is so because, in my opinion, grades are the only way to measure a student\u2019s knowledge and performance.

This essay shall highlight some of the advantages of limiting car usage and how it can help reduce pollution, using examples from Paris and Colombia.\n\nFirstly, limiting the use of cars will help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which, when released into the atmosphere, traps the heat and gradually increases the temperature of the earth. This is known as global warming. According to a report by the World Health Organization, nearly 90% of the world\u2019s population lives in areas with high levels of air pollution, which is very dangerous for our health. Moreover, this causes several respiratory diseases such as asthma. A 2018 study by the World Bank found that if the air pollution in Colombia were to be reduced by 25%, the country would save $1.2 billion every year. Additionally, if the air pollution in Paris were to be reduced by 25%, the city would save $640 million every year. This shows that limiting the use of cars will help reduce air pollution and save money for the countries.\n\nMoreover, limiting the use of cars will help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.

    "The importance of seeking multiple opinions when making a tough decision cannot be stressed enough. Let me elaborate on this by sharing my own experiences and examples. Firstly, I will talk about my own experience when I had to choose a college to pursue my undergraduate studies. Secondly, I will cite an example of a friend who had to make a decision regarding her career.\n\nIn my case, I was not only making a tough decision, but it was also a decision that would have a huge impact on the rest of my life. I had to choose between two colleges that offered the same course. One of the colleges was an excellent college in the city that I lived in, and the other one was a college in the capital city of my country. I was very confused as I did not know which one to choose. I had to take a decision within a week before the application deadline for the college in the capital city would expire.\n\nI was very stressed out and did not know what to do. I asked my friends and family for their opinion. My father and some of my friends advised me to choose the college in my city. They said that the college in the capital city was far away from my hometown and I would not be able to go home very often. They also said that the course in the college in the capital city was more difficult than the course in the college in my city. However, my mother advised me to choose the college in the capital city. She said that I would be able to make new friends and I would be able to get a job very easily once I graduated from the college in the capital city. After a lot of thought, I decided to take my mother\u2019s advice and chose the college in the capital city. I am very happy with my decision as I was able to get a job in a multinational company right after I graduated from the college in the capital city. I feel that I made the right decision because I was able to make new friends and get a job in the capital city.\n\nIn my friend\u2019s case, she had to choose between two different courses. One of the courses was a course in the medical field, and the other course was a course in the engineering field. She was very confused as she did not know which course to choose. She asked some of her friends for their opinion, and some of them advised her to choose the course in the medical field as she was a sensible and intelligent person. However, some of her friends advised her to choose the course in the engineering field as they felt that the course in the medical field was not a good choice for her. After a lot of thought, she decided to take her friends\u2019 advice and chose the course in the engineering field. She is very happy with her decision as she got a good job in the engineering field. She feels that she made the right decision because she was able to get a good job in the engineering field.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is extremely important to seek multiple opinions when making a tough decision. I think that we should take the advice of our friends and family before making a decision. I also think that we should take our own decision because we have to live with the consequences of our decision in the future. We should also think about our future before making a decision.\n\nOther posts:\n\n- Essay on Importance of Reading Books\n- Essay on Importance of Good Habits\n- Essay on Importance of Education\n- Essay on Importance of Sports\n- Essay on Importance of Time\n\nImportant topics for essays\n\n- Essay on Importance of Education\n- Essay on Importance of Sports\n- Essay on Importance of Time\n- Essay on Importance of Good Habits\n- Essay on Importance of Reading Books\n\nRelated Posts\n\n- Essay on Importance of Good Habits\n- Essay on Importance of Education\n- Essay on Importance of Sports\n- Essay on Importance of Time\n\n\u00ab Essay on Importance of Sports\nEssay on Importance of Good Habits \u00bb",

    "Technology has become a key component of the modern education system. Many schools are now using facial recognition software to scan the faces of students and attempt to read their emotions. This technology could be used to improve lesson plans and student engagement, but there are also some serious limitations. Overall, I believe facial recognition software will prove to be an effective tool in the classroom.\n\nThe main benefit of using facial recognition software to read the emotions of students is that it can help teachers tailor lesson plans to individual students. If a teacher can identify a student who is bored or confused during a lesson, they can quickly adjust their teaching style to improve engagement and understanding. Furthermore, the facial recognition software can also identify students who are in a good mood and happy to be in class. This will help teachers to plan activities that encourage these students to participate and help them feel more engaged.\n\nHowever, relying solely on facial recognition to gauge the emotions of students is a flawed system. People have a wide range of facial expressions that do not always correspond with their true emotional state. For example, many people fake a smile when they are not happy. Furthermore, facial recognition technology cannot determine the feelings of the students based on their facial expressions. A student could be feeling confused or frustrated, but the software will not be able to pick up on this.\n\nIn conclusion, while facial recognition technology",

    "Summer projects are an integral part of modern education. However, the question arises whether these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed in order to ensure that students continue learning during their time away from school. I believe that while both approaches have their own benefits and drawbacks, it is more effective to have student-designed summer projects.\n\nMany people argue that student-designed summer projects are more effective as it allows students to apply what they have learned in school to real-life situations. For example, a student who has learned about the topic of conservation of the environment in school can be given a project of designing an eco-friendly house. Thus, students learn how to apply the knowledge they have gained in school to real-life situations.\n\nOn the other hand, some people argue that teacher-designed summer projects are more effective as they ensure that students continue learning during their time away from school. For example, if a teacher gives a math project to a student during the summer, the student does not forget the math concepts that he or she has learned in school. The student also continues to develop his or her mathematical skills.\n\nIn conclusion, it is more effective to have student-designed summer projects as it allows students to apply the concepts they have learned in school to real-life situations. However, teacher-designed summer projects ensure that students continue learning during their time away from school.\n\n[993 words]\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!\n\nBest regards,\n\nD.",
    "When making an important decision, it is a good idea to seek advice from multiple people and combine their different opinions. This approach can lead to better decision-making because it allows an individual to form a more informed opinion. However, it should be noted that it is important to take into account the source of the advice and to ensure that the advice is not influenced by personal bias.\n\nFirstly, seeking advice from multiple people allows an individual to form a more informed opinion. For instance, when buying a house, an individual should seek advice from a real estate agent, a mortgage expert, and a friend who has recently purchased a house. These people can provide relevant information about the advantages and disadvantages of buying a particular house. This information can then be used to make the decision.\n\nSecondly, seeking advice from multiple people can help an individual avoid making a mistake. For example, if an individual is planning to buy a car, it is important to seek advice from people who have recently purchased a car. These individuals can provide important information about the pros and cons of the car and help the individual avoid making a mistake. This is especially important if the individual has little experience buying a car.\n\nOn the other hand, it is important to take into account the source of the advice and to ensure that the advice is not influenced by personal bias. For example, if an individual is seeking advice from a friend who is a car enthusiast, the advice may be biased and the individual may end up making a mistake. Therefore, it is important to seek advice from people who have more experience buying a car.\n\nIn conclusion, when making an important decision, it is a good idea to seek advice from multiple people and combine their different opinions. This approach can lead to better decision-making because it allows an individual to form a more informed opinion.

These vehicles are equipped with a computer system that is capable of driving autonomously (without human input) in certain circumstances. They are able to detect obstacles, traffic signals and other vehicles and act accordingly. Currently they are only able to drive in certain conditions, such as clear weather and free roads. However, the technology is rapidly developing and soon cars will be able to drive in any weather conditions and on any road. This will have a huge impact on transportation and society as a whole.\n\nFirstly, self-driving cars will be able to reach their destination without any human input. This will mean that people will be able to do other things while travelling, such as work, rest or even sleep. This will drastically reduce the amount of accidents that occur on the road, as human error is a major cause of accidents. Furthermore, self-driving cars are able to communicate with each other and the infrastructure, which will allow them to avoid traffic jams and take different routes to their destination. This will increase the efficiency of the roads, which will reduce the time people spend travelling.\n\nSecondly, self-driving cars will be able to travel in large groups. This will reduce the number of cars on the road, which will decrease the amount of traffic. Furthermore, it will reduce the amount of accidents that occur as cars will be travelling in a safe distance from each other.

    "With the increasing population, the world is facing a major problem of overcrowding. This is the reason why there is a growing trend to separate suburban life from auto life use. In my opinion, such a movement can be beneficial for the environment and carbon emissions.\n\nSuburban life is defined as life in the suburbs, which is the outlying residential areas of a city or town. The suburbs are usually more spacious, with less people and pollution. In these areas, there are usually more trees and greenery. The suburbs are also home to many animals, which are essential for the environment. Thus, the suburbs also have a positive effect on the environment. Furthermore, most people in the suburbs own cars, which is a major reason for the high carbon emissions. However, the trend to separate suburban life from auto life use is beneficial for the environment, because people will have to rely on public transportation or cycling. This will reduce carbon emissions and decrease pollution.\n\nSmart planning is a movement which is aimed at improving the environment by planning cities in a more efficient way. Smart planning aims to reduce the use of cars, by making public transportation more efficient and convenient. The use of cars can be reduced by making roads more efficient and by providing more alternatives for public transportation. This will result in less carbon emissions and less pollution. Furthermore, smart planning also aims to make cities more sustainable. This is beneficial for the environment, because it will reduce the amount of energy used by the city. Smart planning is also beneficial for carbon emissions, because the city will become more sustainable, which means that it will require less energy.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that smart planning is beneficial for the environment, because it reduces the use of cars and increases the use of public transportation. Furthermore, smart planning is beneficial for carbon emissions, because it will make the city more sustainable and will reduce the amount of energy used by the city. Therefore, I support smart planning.\n\n(396 words)\n\nThank you so much in advance!\n\nLynne\n\nLynne, I have corrected your first sentence.\nLynne, I have corrected your first sentence.\nIn my opinion, such a movement can be beneficial for the environment and carbon emissions.\nIn my opinion, such a movement can be beneficial for the environment and carbon dioxide emissions.

    "There exists a great controversy about the \"face on Mars\" as some people say that it is a natural landform while others assert that it is a product of artificial engineering. In this essay, I will present both the evidence supporting the natural landform theory and the evidence supporting the artificial engineering theory.\n\nTo start with, the \"face on Mars\" is a natural landform. First, it is situated in a broad valley and it is surrounded by a series of dune fields and domes. In addition, it is a geological formation on the slopes of the Cydonia region of Mars. Moreover, it has a high relief and a large scale. Lastly, it is not a single formation but a complex of elongated ridges with a variety of different widths.\n\nOn the other hand, it is an artificial engineering. First, it has a remarkable symmetry. Second, it is in a perfect alignment with the Cydonia region. Third, it is in a perfect alignment with the Cydonia region.\n\nTo conclude, the \"face on Mars\" is a natural landform.\n\nThank you for your attention.\nSincerely,\nJonas\n\nHi, the essay is quite good.

    "A driverless car is a system of a vehicle that can drive itself without human intervention. Researches show that the use of driverless cars could bring lots of benefits. On the other hand, it could bring some problems. Therefore, it is still a controversial issue. I would like to discuss the positive and negative effects of driverless cars and argue whether or not they should be developed and released to the public.\n\nTo begin with, the development of driverless cars could solve many problems. For example, it could reduce traffic accidents. In addition, it could help solve the problem of traffic congestion. In addition, it could reduce the use of fuel and thus contribute to environmental protection. Moreover, it could help people save time. For instance, it could help people to avoid traffic congestion. In addition, it could solve the problem of parking. More importantly, it could help people save money. For instance, it could help people to avoid paying for gasoline or parking fees. On the other hand, the development of driverless cars could bring some problems. For example, it could increase the unemployment rate. In addition, it could lead to the loss of jobs.

    "The United States of America is the most powerful country in the world. It has a population of 315 million people. It is a federal republic, where the federal government and the state governments both have powers. The federal government has three branches: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. The legislative branch is the Congress, which has two houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The executive branch is headed by the president, who is elected every 4 years. The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court, which has nine judges. The United States of America has a presidential system of government. The president is elected by the people, and he or she has many powers. For example, they can declare war, appoint government officials, and veto bills passed by the Congress. The president is not elected directly by the people, but instead by the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a group of people who represent the states, and who vote for the president. Each state has a certain number of electors, depending on the number of people who live in that state. The candidate who wins the most votes in each state wins all the electors from that state. The candidate who wins the most states wins the election. The Electoral College was created to prevent the candidate with the most votes from winning the election. For example, in the 2000 presidential election, Al Gore won the popular vote, but he lost the electoral vote. George Bush Jr. became president because he won the electoral vote. This is why people argue for or against the Electoral College. Some people argue that it is undemocratic for a candidate to win the election without winning the popular vote. Some people argue that the Electoral College is necessary to protect the interests of smaller states. Some people argue that the Electoral College is necessary to prevent a candidate who is not qualified from becoming president.

    "Some people believe that it is a good idea to allow students to use cell phones while they are in school. Others think that this is a distraction for students and may cause problems. In my opinion, I believe that students should not be allowed to use cell phones while they are in school.\n\nTo begin with, cell phones are a distraction for students. When students are in class, they need to pay attention to what their teacher is saying. If a student's cell phone goes off, it is distracting and the teacher will have to stop teaching and take the call. This is not good for the student's education.\n\nAnother reason why cell phones should not be allowed in school is because they are a distraction for the teacher. Students are always texting each other and talking on their cell phones. This means that the teacher will not be able to teach as well as they should. Teachers need to teach in a quiet classroom so that the students can learn.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that students should not be allowed to use cell phones in school because they are a distraction for the teacher and the student. Students should be taught in a quiet classroom so that they can learn better.\n\nI would be grateful if you could give me some feedback on my essay. Thank",

    "The United States Electoral College system is a system of electing the President and Vice President of the United States through the electors of the presidential electoral college. Under this system, the electors cast their votes to the President and Vice President of the United States. The American Constitution has not specified the details of the Electoral College system, which has resulted in the establishment of a system of electing the President and Vice President of the United States that is different from the system in the United Kingdom, Canada and other Commonwealth countries. The Electoral College system is believed to have been established by the founding fathers of the United States as a compromise between the election of the President by the Congress and the election of the President by a popular vote. The Electoral College system is one of the oldest surviving democratic institutions in the world and has been in existence for more than 200 years. The electoral college system has been criticized for several reasons. The most important reason for the criticism of the Electoral College system is that it does not ensure that the President and Vice President of the United States are elected by the majority of the voters. The electoral college system gives an advantage to the candidate who wins the popular vote in a few states and ignores the desires of the majority of the voters. For example, in the 2016 Presidential Election, Donald Trump won the Presidency with 304 electoral votes, despite winning the popular vote by 2.1 million votes. In the 2000 Presidential Election, Al Gore won the popular vote by 543,895 votes, but lost the Presidency to George W.

    "Finding the right people to ask for advice is very important. It is crucial to find people who are knowledgeable enough to answer our questions and to provide us with useful advice. They should also be able to provide us with a different perspective on a particular problem. The fact that they have a different perspective can be very useful in solving a problem. It can also be useful in finding different approaches to solving a problem.\nIt is also important that the people we ask for advice are able to give us important advice. They should have experience in the field we are asking advice in. For example, if we were to ask for advice on how to buy a house, we would not ask advice from a person who has never bought a house. It would probably be better to ask advice from a person who has bought several houses. The fact that they have bought several houses means they have experience in buying houses and have gained valuable knowledge from buying houses. Knowledge is an important factor in giving advice. Knowledge is what makes a person able to give advice. A person who has no knowledge cannot give advice. Therefore, it is important to ask for advice from people who have knowledge in the field we are asking advice for.\nIt is also important that the people we ask for advice are willing to give us advice.

    "While talking on the phone while driving is not a new phenomenon, the use of cell phones while driving has become a serious concern in recent years. While hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth, can reduce the risk of distracted driving, the use of cell phones while driving is still a serious problem that can be addressed by implementing a stricter law.\n\nThe use of cell phones while driving is a serious problem that can lead to accidents. According to a study conducted by the University of Utah, talking on a cell phone while driving increases the risk of an accident by 400% (Schroeder, 2019). Moreover, talking on a cell phone while driving is more dangerous than texting while driving. Talking on a cell phone while driving is more dangerous than texting because it requires more attention and the driver cannot see the road at the same time. Talking on a cell phone while driving can also be more dangerous than eating or drinking while driving because it requires more attention and the driver cannot see the road at the same time. Moreover, using a cell phone while driving can lead to serious accidents. For example, a man in Alabama died when he was using his cell phone while driving and crashed into a tree.\n\nWhile hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth, can reduce the risk of distracted driving, the use of cell phones while driving is still a serious problem that can be addressed by implementing a stricter law. For example, in Georgia, drivers are not allowed to use their cell phones while driving. However, as I will explain below, drivers are still using their cell phones while driving.

    "The existence of extraterrestrial life has been a subject of debate for centuries. Many scientists believe that the possibility of life on other planets is high, and they are eager to explore the planets in our solar system. Venus is a planet that is similar in size and mass to Earth, and scientists believe that it is a likely candidate for having life on it. However, the planet is inhospitable to humans because the atmosphere is too hot and the weather patterns are too violent. In this essay, I will analyse the potential benefits of studying Venus, the challenges that scientists face in exploring the planet, and the possibility of finding evidence of life on the planet.\n\nOne of the benefits of studying Venus is to discover if life exists on the planet. Since Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, it is possible that life exists there. Therefore, scientists can analyse the planet to determine if it has the same conditions as Earth. For example, we can study the planet's atmosphere, weather patterns, and composition to determine if it has the same conditions as Earth. If we discover that the planet has the same conditions as Earth, we can conclude that life exists on the planet. This would be a huge breakthrough for scientists because it would prove that life exists on other planets.\n\nAnother benefit of studying Venus is to understand the planet's past and present conditions. We can look at the planet's atmosphere to determine if it was once similar to Earth's. We can also study the planet's weather patterns to determine if they are similar to Earth's. Finally, we can analyse the composition of the planet to determine if it has the same composition as Earth. These studies would help us understand how the planet formed and evolved over time. This would be useful for scientists because it would help them understand how life on Earth formed and evolved over time.\n\nHowever, there are",

Driverless cars will be safer than driving a regular car because they will be less likely to get into an accident. Driverless cars will also be eco-friendly because they will run on electricity instead of gas. Driverless cars will also have the latest technology because they will learn from each other and from their surroundings. Driverless cars will be able to learn from each other by using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Driverless cars will be able to learn from their surroundings by using sensors. For example, a driverless car will be able to sense if a pedestrian is crossing the road. The driverless car will then be able to stop and not run over the pedestrian.\n\nDriverless cars will offer a variety of benefits to society.

    "The United States uses the electoral college system to decide who will be the president. The electoral college has been in place since the founding fathers of the United States drafted the Constitution. The electoral college system has been in place for centuries and it is time to have a change. The popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college for presidential elections because the popular vote is more fair, it makes the candidates work harder to get votes, and it makes the country more united.\n\nThe popular vote is more fair than the electoral college system. The electoral college system allows for candidates to win the presidency even if they lost the popular vote. The electoral college system was created to prevent the larger states from dominating the smaller states. The electoral college system was not intended to be used for presidential elections, but it is still used today. The popular vote system is fairer to all the states because the larger states cannot dominate the smaller states.

    "Community service is an activity which helps a person to grow personally, helps their community, and ultimately helps the individual to grow. Community service is an important part of growing up and becoming a good person. It is extremely significant for every student to participate in community service. There are many advantages to participating in community service, including but not limited to the development of good character, the development of a sense of civic responsibility, and the development of good citizenship skills. On the other hand, not participating in community service can result in a variety of negative consequences, including but not limited to a lack of moral character, a lack of civic responsibility, and a lack of good citizenship skills. Schools can encourage and facilitate community service among their students by providing opportunities for students to participate in community service, providing transportation for students to participate in community service, and providing recognition for students who participate in community service. \n\nI am looking forward to hearing from you.

    "The use of cell phones in school should be allowed because they make it easier for students to communicate with their peers, family and teaching staff. To begin with, students can easily communicate with their peers outside of school hours. This is beneficial because they can exchange ideas about homework and tests and seek advice from one another. For example, if a student is having trouble understanding a mathematical formula, he can use his cell phone to contact a classmate who is a math whiz and ask for help. Furthermore, students can communicate with their family members. This is beneficial because they can get help with their homework. In addition, they can ask for permission to attend school events. For instance, if a student has a school dance coming up, he can use his cell phone to contact his family to ask for permission to go.

    "The use of cell phones during class time can be a major distraction for both teachers and students. As a result, some schools have banned cell phone use in the classroom altogether, while others have implemented regulations that allow students to use cell phones under certain circumstances. While I agree that cell phones should be banned from school, I believe that some exceptions may be acceptable.\n\nOn one hand, cell phones can be distracting for students and teachers. When students are texting or looking at their phones during class time, they are not paying attention to what the teacher is saying. As a result, the quality of the lesson may be affected. In addition, students who are using their cell phones during class may be less likely to participate in class discussions or activities. Teachers may also have to stop their lesson to answer a student\u2019s question about the cell phone.\n\nOn the other hand, cell phones can be useful tools in the classroom. For example, teachers can use cell phones to communicate with parents about a student\u2019s behavior or grades. In addition, cell phones can be used to take pictures of classroom activities, which can be used as a reference for students who missed a lesson. Finally, cell phones can be used in case of an emergency.\n\nIn conclusion, while I believe that the use of cell phones during class time should be banned altogether, I think there should be some exceptions. For example, students should be allowed to use cell phones in case of an emergency or to communicate with their parents.\n\nThank you very much for your",

    "The advent of technology has led to the development of devices that claim to detect emotions in humans. While such technology has the potential to aid in the development of artificial intelligence, it is important to consider the limitations of such technology before implementing it. This essay will first discuss the effectiveness of such technology and then consider its reliability.\n\nThe effectiveness of technology that claims to detect emotions in humans is based on the premise that emotions are expressed through facial expressions and body language. While such technology can be used to determine the effectiveness of a particular product or service, it can also be used to improve the efficiency of the human resource department.

    "The Electoral College is the method for selecting the president of the United States. The Electoral College is based on the idea that the citizens of the United States should not directly elect the president, but rather choose a group of people, called electors, to vote on their behalf. The constitution of the United States of America states that the Electoral College will be made up of 538 electors and the candidate with the majority of the electoral votes will win the election. The Electoral College is composed of 100 senators, 435 representatives and 3 electors from the District of Columbia. The importance of the Electoral College is that it is a compromise between allowing the people of the United States to choose the president and allowing the states to choose the president. Each state has as many electors as it has senators and representatives in Congress. The candidate who receives the most popular votes in a state receives all of that state\u2019s electoral votes. The winner of the popular vote in each state receives all of that state\u2019s electoral votes. This method of voting allows the smaller states to have more power in the election process. The Electoral College has been used since the first presidential election in 1789. The Electoral College was used in the 2016 presidential election and was used in the 2016 presidential election. The Electoral College is not a perfect system but it is an efficient system and it should not be changed.\nI would like to thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nGyldenAfterTime: It's not great, but it's not terrible either.

    "The pursuit of studying Venus is worth the potential dangers, and it could lead to significant discoveries that could benefit humanity. The article \u201cVenus: The \u2018Evening Star\u2019\u201d by David Whitehouse, explains the dangers of studying Venus and the potential discoveries that could benefit humanity. Paragraph 8 of the article explains the dangers of studying Venus. Paragraph 8 states, \u201cThis is a planet so extreme that even the NASA scientists who are planning the mission have a hard time believing that it's possible to survive there.\u201d Paragraph 8 also states, \u201cThe atmosphere of Venus is so dense and hot that it would be impossible to send a human being there. The heat would be unbearable. The pressure would be crushing. The radiation would be dangerous. The only hope is to send robots.\u201d Venus is much more extreme than Earth, and it would be very difficult to survive. Paragraph 9 of the article explains the potential discoveries that could benefit humanity. Paragraph 9 states,\n\nIf Venus is indeed a rocky planet like Earth, it would mean that the solar system has two rocky planets in its habitable zone. That is a very important clue about the possibilities of life on planets around other stars. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in the solar system.

There is a possibility that they created us. This is evidence because the aliens are like the cockroaches of the universe. Another piece of evidence is the recent discovery that the face on Mars was actually a Martian mesa. This evidence suggests that aliens are capable of taking over the world and making humans do work.

    "It is generally agreed that education is a fundamental human right. Students should be given the opportunity to learn and to develop their potential. However, they should also be asked to contribute to their communities.\n\nThe benefits of mandatory community service for students include that it helps them to learn about the community. In addition, it helps them to develop social skills and to learn about the needs of others. Finally, it helps them to become more active and engaged citizens. Mandatory community service programs can be very beneficial to students.\n\nFirstly, students who do community service are given the opportunity to learn about the community in which they live. This is important because it encourages them to get to know their neighbors and to understand the issues affecting their community. Furthermore, they learn about issues such as poverty, homelessness, and racism. This is very important because it helps them to develop their understanding of the world around them.\n\nSecondly, community service helps students to develop social skills.

    "When faced with a difficult situation, it is always wise to get multiple perspectives. This can help you to gain a better understanding of the situation, make better decisions and improve your opinions. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of consulting multiple people when faced with a difficult situation or argument.\n\nFirstly, getting multiple perspectives can help you to gain a better understanding of the situation. By getting different perspectives, it can help you to identify the problem as well as to see the situation from different perspectives. For example, when my friend was invited to a party, he was given two options; either to attend the event with his girlfriend or to go with his friends. By consulting his girlfriend, he got to know that his girlfriend had no problem with him attending the party with his friends. On the other hand, consulting his friends helped him to know what the party was like and what activities he could do there. By getting two different perspectives, he was able to gain a better understanding of the situation and decide whether to attend the party with his girlfriend or with his friends.\n\nSecondly, getting multiple perspectives can help you to make better decisions. By getting different perspectives, you can weigh the pros and cons of the situation. For example, when I was going to buy a new car, I consulted my family members. My father advised me to buy a car which could run on petrol as it would be cheaper to run and maintain. On the other hand, my mother advised me to buy a car which could run on petrol as",
    "In the past, people have always preferred to consult with experts and experienced individuals when they are faced with an important decision to make. In today's world, however, asking for advice from multiple people is becoming one of the most popular ways for individuals to make better decisions.\n\nThere are several reasons why asking for advice from multiple people is a good way for individuals to make better decisions. One of the most important reasons is that individuals can get a variety of perspectives in the decision making process. For example, if an individual is going to move to another country, he or she can ask for advice from a number of people, including friends, family members, and colleagues. Each group can give different perspectives and opinions about the decision. This will help the individual to make a better decision.\n\nAnother reason is that individuals can gain more confidence by asking for advice from multiple people. For example, if an individual is going to start a new business, he or she can ask for advice from a number of people. Each group can give different perspectives and opinions about the decision. This will help the individual to make a better decision.

    "Extracurricular activities are a part of school life. They are not only a form of entertainment, but also a means of self-development. In my opinion, extracurricular activities are a great opportunity to discover new passions, gain valuable experiences and improve physical and mental health.\nFirstly, extracurricular activities are a great opportunity to discover new passions. For example, when I was in high school, I was not good at mathematics, but my friend convinced me to join the math club. I thought it was a waste of time, because I would never be good at math, but I gave it a try. To my surprise, I found that, with practice, I could become good at math. The math club helped me to discover my passion for math and I am now majoring in mathematics in college.\nSecondly, extracurricular activities are a great opportunity to gain valuable experiences. For example, when I was in high school, my school offered a variety of activities, including a math club, an engineering club, a drama club, a basketball team, a soccer team, and a volleyball team. I joined the math club, the drama club, the basketball team and the volleyball team. I enjoyed the math club, the drama club and the basketball team, but I was not as passionate about volleyball as I was about the other activities. I played volleyball as a way to stay in shape, but I did not feel passionate about it. I quit the volleyball team and focused on the other activities that I enjoyed.\nThirdly, extracurricular activities are a great opportunity to improve physical and mental health. For example, when I was in high school, I was very active. I played on the basketball team, the soccer team and the volleyball team. I also ran track. I considered myself to be a healthy person. However, I was not a healthy person. I was not eating properly and I was not sleeping properly. I was not taking care of my physical and mental health. I decided to quit the basketball team, the soccer team and the volleyball team, and focus on my physical and mental health.\n\nHowever, I do not believe that extracurricular activities are necessary for self-development, because some people are not interested in extracurricular activities. For example, when I was in high school, I was not interested in extracurricular activities. I was not involved in any extracurricular activities. I was not interested in extracurricular activities. I was not interested in extracurricular activities.\nI have discussed the benefits of participating in extracurricular activities outside of the home.

    "Online classes are becoming more and more popular among students as they can be more flexible than traditional classes. There are various benefits of online classes, such as time management, mental health, and overall academic performance. However, there are also some disadvantages of online classes, such as the lack of communication and failure to develop social skills. In my opinion, online classes are a great way to improve time management and mental health, but I believe that they can negatively affect academic performance. Because of this, I believe that online classes should be implemented with traditional classes.\n\nFirst of all, online classes can be very beneficial for students who struggle with time management. For example, students can have more time to do their homework and complete their assignments. This can be done by setting aside a specific time each day for homework, which could be done before or after school. In addition, online classes allow students to be more flexible with their schedules. For example, students can take online classes at night or on weekends instead of having to go to school during the day. These benefits of time management can help students achieve academic success.\n\nSecondly, online classes can help students improve their mental health. For example, students can take online classes from the comfort of their homes, which can help reduce feelings of stress or anxiety. In addition, students can work at their own pace, which may reduce feelings of pressure or competition from other students. These benefits of mental health can improve academic performance by reducing feelings of anxiety or stress that might affect a student\u2019s ability to focus and learn effectively.\n\nFinally, I believe that online classes can negatively affect academic performance. For example, students may not have access to the same level of resources as they would in a traditional classroom. For example, students may not have access to a teacher or a classroom setting where they can ask questions or receive feedback from their peers. In addition, students may not have access to the same level of technology in an online classroom, which could affect their ability to learn effectively. Finally, students may not have access to the same level of social interaction as they would in a traditional classroom, which could affect their ability to develop social skills and learn effectively from others. Because of this, I believe that online classes should be implemented with traditional classes to maximize academic performance.\n",
    "Transportation is a necessity for every human being to complete a task. There are many different ways to go from point A to point B, one of which is by vehicle. It is crucial to be conscious of the environmental impact of transportation, as it is a significant source of air pollution. Despite the fact that there are many alternatives to personal transportation, the majority of society still relies on vehicles to get where they need to go. The majority of the world's population has access to a vehicle, and the number of cars is increasing. As a result, we must consider the effects that vehicles have on the environment, as well as the potential alternatives that could make our world a safer place.\n\nIn the United States, there are nearly 250 million registered vehicles, which is more than the entire population of the country. This is the result of the fact that many people rely on their cars for transportation. This is not only a problem in the United States, but it is also a global issue.

Another method of transportation is car-free zones, which are areas where cars are not allowed to drive. This method reduces the amount of pollution caused by vehicles, as well as the number of vehicles on the road and the amount of air pollution.

These activities help him in making his life a meaningful one. They also help in making his future bright. There are many activities in school. Sometimes it becomes very difficult for a student to attend all the classes. It is a common thing for a student to get sick. When he gets sick, he cannot go to school. In such a situation, he is unable to attend all the classes. The students who live far away from their school also face this problem. They cannot go to school because of their distance. If they go to school, it will take a lot of time for them to reach school. In such a situation, they cannot attend all the classes. In such cases, the students face a lot of problems.

    "There are two main types of education: traditional learning and online learning. Traditional learning takes place in classrooms, where teachers have a more significant role in teaching. On the other hand, online learning allows students to have more freedom to study while also learning to self-manage their time. Online learning has many advantages and disadvantages.\nThe first advantage of online learning is that it allows students to study at their own pace. Students can take their time to understand the subject without feeling pressured. This is helpful for people who struggle with learning and need more time to understand. Another advantage of online learning is that it is more convenient than traditional learning. Students can study at their own pace and at any time they want. They do not have to worry about commuting to school or finding babysitters to take care of their children while they are at school. Online learning also allows students to learn at their own pace.

    "While it is a common belief that obtaining multiple opinions is essential to make wise choices, I would like to argue that it is not always the case. In my opinion, seeking multiple opinions is not always the best way to make decisions, and should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAlthough seeking multiple opinions is a great way to get more information, it is not always the best way to make decisions. For example, when my father was diagnosed with cancer, I was advised by my family to seek opinions from multiple doctors. However, when I consulted with the doctors, I was told that there is no need to seek another opinion, and the treatment that my father is undergoing is the best. If I had not followed the advice of my family, and had sought multiple opinions, I would have wasted a lot of time in collecting information and making a decision, which would have been useless in the end.\n\nIn addition, seeking multiple opinions might not always be the right thing to do. For example, I have always been interested in studying medicine, and I knew that I wanted to become a doctor. However, my parents wanted me to pursue a career in engineering, and they were very insistent that I take up engineering. I decided to go against my parents\u2019 advice, and to pursue my dream of becoming a doctor. If I had sought multiple opinions, I would not have been able to pursue my dream.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that seeking multiple opinions is not always the best way to make decisions. In my opinion, it is important to consider the pros and cons of seeking multiple opinions, and to take into account the individual circumstances, before making decisions.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nPlease rate my essay\n\nRegards,\nVinay\n\nEssay topics: Please rate my essay\n\nPosted by: Vinay\n\nPlease rate my essay\n\nHello,\n\nI would be glad if you could rate my essay.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nPrompt: \u201cWe can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them\u201d (Albert Einstein). Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and examples.\n\n\u201c We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them\u201d (Albert Einstein). Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and examples.\n\nIt is often said that we can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them. I totally agree with this statement, as I believe that the same way of thinking is not always applicable to solve problems. I would like to explain this concept with the help of two examples.\n\nThe first example is related to my experience of a power cut at my home. I live in Bangalore, which is a city that is known for its high power demand and shortage of power supply. On one particular day, the power supply to my flat was cut due to a technical glitch in the transformer. I was unable to understand what had happened, and why the power had",
    "In the era of globalization, teachers and parents have to find the best ways to motivate and engage students in learning. The main problem is that the traditional school system does not always meet the needs of the students and the society. As a result, many students do not see the point of studying. In order to solve this problem, some teachers suggest using student-designed summer projects as a way to promote learning and creativity among students. However, other teachers argue that teacher-designed summer projects have more positive effects. In my opinion, teacher-designed summer projects are more effective in promoting learning and creativity among students.\n\nTo begin with, teacher-designed summer projects are more effective in promoting learning and creativity among students because they are more practical and relevant to the real world. For example, in science, students are able to design and conduct experiments and they are able to apply what they have learned in school in real life. In addition, teacher-designed summer projects allow students to learn how to work in teams and they help students become more independent learners. Furthermore, teacher-designed summer projects are more effective in promoting learning and creativity among students because they give students the opportunity to learn from each other. Students have the opportunity to learn more about each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and they have the opportunity to learn from each other. In addition, teacher-designed summer projects allow students to learn from each other and they help students become more independent learners. In addition, teacher-designed summer projects allow students to learn from each other and they help students become more independent learners.\n\nOn the other hand, student-designed summer projects are not as effective in promoting learning and creativity among students because they are not as practical and relevant to the real world. For example, in science, students are not able to design and conduct experiments and they are not able to apply what they have learned in school in real life. In addition, student-designed summer projects do not give students the opportunity to learn from each other and they do not help students become more independent learners. Lastly, student-designed summer projects do not give students the opportunity to learn from each other and they do not help students become more independent learners.\n\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, teacher-designed summer projects are more effective in promoting learning and creativity among students because they are more practical and relevant to the real world. Moreover, teacher-designed summer projects allow",
    "Online or video conferencing programs can benefit students in terms of providing more flexibility in their schedules, reducing transportation time and stress, and allowing for a more comfortable and focused learning environment. However, there are also potential drawbacks to such programs, which can be addressed to ensure that students remain engaged and responsible in their studies.\n\nFirstly, online or video conferencing programs provide students with more flexibility in their schedules. As a result, students can work more hours at their part-time jobs or take care of their family members, while still being able to attend classes. In addition, students do not have to worry about transportation and can save time and money on gas. Therefore, students can learn and earn at the same time.\n\nSecondly, online or video conferencing programs can reduce transportation time and stress. For example, students who live far from their university can attend classes without having to commute, which can be very convenient and comfortable for them. Also, students who live near their university do not have to worry about traffic and can arrive to classes on time.\n\nThirdly, online or video conferencing programs allow students to study in a more comfortable and focused environment. For example, students can study in their dorms or in their beds, which can be more comfortable for them. Also, students can study in a more focused way, as there are fewer distractions around them.\n\nHowever, online or video conferencing programs can be a drawback to students who do not",
    "I have been working as a seagoing cowboy for 7 years, and I have travelled to 5 countries. The job is to care for the cattle on the ship and during the trip. My responsibilities are to look after the animals and to make sure that they are safe, healthy, and ready for sale. It is a challenging job, but I am always up for a challenge. I love animals and I love the sea, so this job is the perfect combination for me. I have also learned a lot about different cultures and different animals. I have learned about the different breeds of cattle, and how different types of animals react to different situations. It was a great experience and I enjoyed every minute of it. I am very passionate about animals and I would love to continue working as a seagoing cowboy.

You can\u2019t just call yourself a seagoing cowboy, as that\u2019s a very specific job that not many people have. I think you should use something like \u201cseagoing livestock worker\u201d instead.\n\nI think your essay needs to be more specific about your responsibilities on ship. You need to describe your job very clearly, and explain what you did every day. You should also include some information about the challenges you faced, and your reflections on the job.\n\nFinally, I think the last paragraph should be a conclusion, not a conclusion and a promise to continue working as a seagoing cowboy. You should make it clear that you have learned a lot from your experience, and how this has impacted your life.\n\nHope that helps,\nTobias\n\nAnkit 2019-03-07 00:35:57 UTC #3\n\nThank you very much for the feedback.

In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why the use of private cars is decreasing in many cities and towns and I will also discuss some of the benefits of this trend.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why the use of private cars is decreasing in many cities and towns. One of the main reasons is that many people are concerned about the environment and they are trying to reduce their carbon footprint. Another reason is that many people are concerned about the rising cost of petrol and they are looking for alternatives to driving. Finally, many people are using public transport because it is often cheaper than driving.\n\nThere are also a number of benefits to this trend. One benefit is that it makes the streets safer. Another benefit is that it reduces traffic congestion.

    "Sports are an important part of a school's extracurricular activities. However, some students are not able to participate in sports because they have a lower grade average than the required B average. Therefore, I believe that students with grades below a B average should not be allowed to participate in school sports and other activities.\n\nFirst of all, according to the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP), \"students who participate in extracurricular activities are more likely to graduate from high school and are more likely to graduate from college, have higher grade point averages, and have fewer absences than students who do not participate in extracurricular activities\" (nassp.org).

    "When a person is faced with making a decision, he or she should seek advice from multiple people. This is due to the fact that gathering multiple opinions helps in making a better choice. The benefits of seeking advice from multiple people when making a decision are as follows: it provides a person with a wider perspective, it helps in making a better choice and it helps in identifying the drawbacks of a decision.\nTo begin with, when a person seeks advice from multiple people, he or she is exposed to a wider perspective. For example, when a student is trying to decide between two pairs of shoes, he or she may ask his or her friends for their opinion. The student's friends may bring to his or her attention the fact that one of the pairs of shoes is out of fashion, and that he or she should choose the other pair. This is a case of a wider perspective being exposed to the student. Another example is if a student is trying to decide between two extracurricular activities. He or she may ask his or her friends for their opinion. His or her friends may bring to his or her attention the fact that one of the extracurricular activities is more fun. Again, this is a case of a wider perspective being exposed to the student.\nSecondly, when a person seeks advice from multiple people, he or she is likely to make a better choice.

    "In today's society, the use of technology is rapidly increasing. One of the main devices that is widely used is a cell phone. Cell phones are very popular, and a majority of students use them every day. Students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school, as there are various advantages of doing so. One of the main advantages is that students can contact their parents if they need to. For example, if a student is in an emergency situation such as an accident, they will be able to call their parents immediately. Also, they can contact their parents if they are lost in the school. Another advantage is that students can contact their parents if they forget something at home. For example, if a student forgets his/her lunch at home, he/she can contact their parents and ask them to bring a lunch box to school. In addition, students can contact their parents if they are ill. For example, if a student is ill and cannot attend school, he/she can contact their parents and ask them to take the student to the doctor. However, there are various disadvantages of allowing students to bring cell phones to school. One of the main disadvantages is that students can access the internet. For example",
    "In today\u2019s world, students have to compete with other students in order to get jobs and make a living. The competition is very tough and to make sure they are successful, they need to develop certain skills and qualities that will help them in the future.

    "When making a decision, it is always good to seek advice from other people. There are several benefits of doing so. I will discuss a few of those here.\n\nFirst of all, other people can give you a fresh perspective on the problem at hand. For example, if you are trying to decide whether you should move to a new country, your friends may be able to help you to decide whether the new country is suitable for you.\n\nSecondly, other people can give you advice based on their own experiences. For example, if you are trying to decide whether you should invest in a new business, you may be able to get some good advice from your friends who have already tried this before.\n\nFinally, other people can give you unbiased advice. For example, if you are trying to decide whether you should buy a new car, your friends may be able to give you some good advice on whether the car you are looking at is a good choice.\n\nIn conclusion, seeking advice from other people can be very beneficial. I hope that you will consider getting advice from your friends and family next time you are faced with a difficult decision.\n__________________\nalways trying to improve!\n\nLast edited by ctn; 07-06-2019 at 11:16 AM. \n\n  #2\n07-06-2019, 11:44 AM \n\nctn \nSenior Manager\n\n  \n\nJoin Date: Oct 2015\nLocation: Australia\nPosts: 735\n\nRe: IELTS Speaking Test in Australia - June 2019\n\nSpeaking test\n\nInterview\n- What is your full name?\n- Can I see your ID?\n- Where are you from?\n- Do you work or study?\n- What is your job?\n- Do you like your job?\n- What kind of car do you drive?\n- Is it a new or used one?\n- Do you like to drive?\n- Why?\n- Do",
    "The current system of the Electoral College is not perfect and needs to be changed. I believe that the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. This would allow every vote to be counted and every vote to matter. The Electoral College is not the best system because it only allows a few states to matter. If a candidate wins the popular vote in a state, they get all of the electoral votes in that state. This means that every vote does not matter because if one party gets the popular vote in a state, they will get all of the electoral votes. This means some states will not matter because they are not voting for the popular vote, and some states will have a lot of electoral votes because they have more people and are more popular. Some states will not matter as much as others because they will not have enough electoral votes to win the election.

    "At present, majority of the students in the US have a B average in order to participate in gym class. However, I believe there should not be any rules or regulations to attend gym class. Rather, the teachers should encourage the students to participate. It is not a good idea to be forced to attend gym class. This is because majority of the students have a lot of things to do at home and they do not want to spend time on gym.

    "The idea of allowing students to complete their school work at home is a controversial one. While there are certain drawbacks that come with this, including the fact that it is hard to stay focused and have access to resources, there are also many advantages.\n\nThe first disadvantage of allowing students to complete their school work at home is that it is hard to stay focused. Students, having the freedom to complete their school work at home, may get distracted by other things, such as the television or the Internet. Furthermore, some students may be easily distracted by their desire to play video games or hang out with their friends. While there is nothing wrong with these activities in moderation, they can be very distracting when they are done excessively.\n\nAnother disadvantage of allowing students to complete their school work at home is that it is hard to have access to resources. For example, if a student is stuck on a math problem, it is hard to have access to a teacher or tutor to help. Instead, the student would have to rely on the Internet, which may not always be accurate. Furthermore, it is hard to have classmates to help, as they may be in a completely different time zone or not be available at the time the student is working.\n\nDespite the drawbacks, there are many advantages to allowing students to complete their school work at home. The number one advantage is that it saves time, as there is no need to commute back and forth from school. Furthermore, it allows students to work at their own pace, so they do not have to rush through their work to keep up with their classmates. Lastly, it allows students to complete their school work at a time that is convenient for them, rather than having to adjust their schedules to fit their classes.\n\nIn conclusion, allowing students to complete their school work at home has many advantages, but it also has drawbacks, including not being able to focus and having access to resources. Despite this, I believe that the advantages outweigh the drawbacks, and that this is a positive change that will help students in many ways.\n\nWords: 564\nEssay by: Anushka\nWord count: 564\n\nThank you so much for your kind help!\n\nComments for How can I improve my essay?

    "Air pollution is one of the most hazardous problems that have been faced by the entire world. The United States is one of the countries that have been struggling with this problem for long. One of the major reasons for the air pollution is the increase in the number of automobiles on the roads. The US is known for its high rate of transportation in cars and other private vehicles. The percentage of greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes is huge. The US has not been able to control this issue which is directly related to the increase in the number of automobiles on the roads. The increase in the number of vehicles has also triggered a rise in the number of accidents on the roads. The US is the most powerful country in the world. It should be able to find a solution to this problem. The country should focus on reducing the number of automobiles on the roads. It has also been found that the number of public transportations is lower in the US in comparison to other countries. The US should focus on increasing the number of public transportations. The US should also focus on the use of public transportations in reducing the number of private vehicles on the roads. The US should also focus on promoting the use of electric cars.

    "The best way to find out the truth is by seeking multiple opinions. In a situation where we have to decide what is the best way to solve a certain problem, we have to find the most trustworthy persons to give us advice. By doing so, we are able to combine different points of view and experiences in order to come up with the best solution to the problem.\n\nFirstly, one of the most important benefits of seeking multiple opinions is that we can get different points of view on the issue. For example, I had a problem with my apartment last year. I thought it was very humid and I could not sleep properly because I felt hot and sweaty. I asked my friends what they thought about my problem and I was surprised to hear that they said that they had the same problem. I was really happy to hear that I was not the only one who was feeling that way. I asked them if they knew how to solve it and they told me that they had some problems with their air conditioners last year and they had to change them. Then I thought that the problem could be in the air conditioners and I asked my parents to change them. This was the best solution to the problem and now I can sleep well.\n\nSecondly, the most important benefit of seeking multiple opinions is that we can get experiences from different people. For example, when my mother was diagnosed with cancer, I was very worried. I did not know what to do and I did not know what to say to her. I asked my friends what they would do in my situation and they all gave me very different ideas. Some of them said that I should tell my mother that everything will be okay and that I will always be there for her. Others said that I should tell my mother that she is strong and that she will be fine. In the end, I decided to tell my mother that everything will be okay and that I will always be there for her. This was the best thing to do and now my mother is very happy.\n\nThirdly, one of the most important benefits of seeking multiple opinions is that we can learn from different people. For example, I learned a lot from my friends when I had a problem with my apartment last year. They told me that some of their friends had the same problem and that they had to change their air conditioners. They also told me that the problem could be in the air conditioners. Then I thought about it and I realized that the problem could be in the air conditioners. I asked my parents to change them. This was the best solution to the problem and now I",
    "As technology advances, it appears to be becoming more and more invasive of our privacy. One of the most recent and popular examples of this is the use of facial expression technology. Facial expression technology uses facial recognition to identify and monitor people in public places, using cameras, for example, at train stations, airports and other public places. The technology then identifies the people in public places, and records and stores their facial expressions, which can then be used to identify them and monitor their behaviour. There are many ethical concerns surrounding this technology, including ethical concerns surrounding the use of facial expression technology in public places, and ethical concerns surrounding the use of facial expression technology in the work place.\n\nOne of the most concerning issues surrounding the use of facial expression technology in public places is the issue of invasion of privacy. In public places, people are not expecting to have their faces identified, and their facial expressions recorded and stored by a technology. This means that it is an invasion of privacy to use this technology in public places. The privacy of people in public places is also threatened by the issue of data retention. The facial expression technology records and stores the facial expressions of people in public places, and this data is stored on databases for future use. This means that there is a threat to the privacy of people in public places, as their facial expressions are stored on databases, which can be accessed by anyone, including the government. This is a threat to the privacy of the",
    "There is a proverb in English speaking countries that says: \u201cTwo heads are better than one\u201d. This is a very common proverb that is used in a variety of situations, particularly when referring to the benefits of teamwork. I believe this proverb is particularly applicable to the context of seeking advice from multiple people when making decisions. In my opinion, seeking advice from multiple people is a very positive practice that can provide many benefits and drawbacks. This essay will discuss these benefits and drawbacks in detail.\n\nOn the one hand, seeking advice from multiple people when making decisions can provide many benefits. First, seeking advice from multiple people can provide a more comprehensive view of an issue. For example, if an individual is making a decision about whether to buy a car, he or she may not be aware of all of the advantages and disadvantages of buying a car. However, if he or she seeks advice from multiple people, he or she may be able to gain a more comprehensive view of the situation. Second, seeking advice from multiple people can help an individual to feel more confident about his or her decision. For example, if an individual is very indecisive about whether to buy a car, he or she may be able to feel more confident about his or her decision after seeking advice from multiple people. Finally, seeking advice from multiple people can help an individual to consider a wider range of options. For example, if an individual is making a decision about whether to buy a car, he or she may not be aware of all of the options available to him or her. However, if he or she seeks advice from multiple people, he or she may be able to gain a more comprehensive view of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, seeking advice from multiple people can provide many drawbacks. First, seeking advice from multiple people can sometimes result in the individual being unable to make a decision. For example, if an individual is seeking advice from multiple people about whether to buy a car, he or she may end up not being able to decide. Second, seeking advice from multiple people can sometimes result in the individual being unable to take action. For example, if an individual is seeking advice from multiple people about whether to buy a car, he or she may end up not taking any action. Finally, seeking advice from multiple people can sometimes result in the individual being unable to move on with his or her life. For example, if an individual is seeking advice from multiple people about whether to buy a car, he or she may end up not being able to move on with his or her life.\n\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, seeking advice from multiple people when making decisions is a very positive practice that can provide many benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, seeking advice from multiple people can provide many benefits. On the other hand, seeking advice from multiple people can provide many drawbacks.\n\n3\n\nEssay Writing Tips / Re: essay writing tips\n\n\u00ab on: January 08, 2021, 08:59:13 AM \u00bb\nHi, I can't see your essay.

    "The Facial Action Coding System, called FACS, is a system of classifying facial expressions in order to determine a person's emotions. The system was developed by Paul Ekman in 1978 in order to help medical professionals diagnose illnesses and disorders. The system has since been used in a variety of fields, including psychology, education, and business. In this essay I will argue that FACS should be implemented in the classroom to gauge student emotions and adjust teaching methods accordingly. The potential benefits and drawbacks of this system will be considered, as well as alternative methods for gauging student emotions. Based on my analysis, I will argue that FACS should be used to improve the classroom experience for students and teachers.\n\nThe primary benefit of using FACS to gauge student emotions is that the system is highly accurate. In addition, the system does not require any input from the students, so it is not invasive like some other methods. For example, a student may not want to admit that he is feeling sad because he is worried that his teacher will think he is lazy or unmotivated. The teacher may then respond by giving the student extra work or trying to get the rest of the class to make him feel better, which could make the student feel even worse. FACS would not require the student to express his emotions and the teacher would not have to guess what the student is feeling. This would greatly reduce the chances of the student becoming embarrassed or uncomfortable.\n\nAnother potential benefit of using FACS to gauge student emotions is that it is much more accurate than other methods. For example, a teacher could ask a student how he is feeling, but the student may not be able to accurately describe his emotions. Alternatively, a teacher may observe a student's body language and facial expression, but this may not be a reliable method of gauging emotions. FACS can be used to accurately detect a person's emotions. For example, if a student is happy, his eyebrows will be raised and his eyes will be wide open. If he is sad, his eyebrows will be lowered and his eyes will be narrowed.\n\nA potential drawback of using FACS to gauge student emotions is that it is expensive. For example, the system requires a lot of training in order to be effective, which can be costly. Another drawback is that the system may not accurately detect student emotions. For example, if a student is happy, his eyebrows may not be raised, or if he is sad, his eyebrows may not be lowered. In addition, the system may be difficult for teachers to use because it requires them to look at the students' faces in order to be accurate.\n\nA potential benefit of using FACS to gauge student emotions is that it provides teachers with a lot of useful information about their students. For example, a teacher may notice that a student is sad after taking a test. The teacher may then ask the student how he is feeling and the student may tell him that he is sad because he did not do well on the test. The teacher may then give the student extra help or praise him for doing a good job on the test. This would help the student feel better about himself and motivate him to do better on future tests.\n\nA potential drawback of using FACS to gauge student emotions is that it may not be effective in all situations. For example, if a teacher observes a student's facial expression and determines that he is sad, the teacher may then try to cheer the student up. However, this may not always work because the student may not be sad at all. In addition, the teacher may not be able to accurately determine if the student is sad because the student may not be sad at all. For example, a student may be happy because he did well on a test, but the teacher may think he is sad because he did not do well on the test.\n\nIn conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System, called FACS, can be used to gauge student emotions and adjust teaching methods accordingly. This can be beneficial in many ways, including increasing the effectiveness of the classroom experience. However, there are also drawbacks to using FACS, including cost and accuracy. Based on my analysis, I believe that FACS should be used to improve the classroom experience for students and teachers.\n\nhttps://www.essaywritingservice.com.au/\n\n0\n\nBy Guest\n\n- 0\n\nRelated topics Recommended Posts\n\n- 0\n\nHow to write an essay in the correct format\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay Introduction\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in 1 Hour\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in English\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in 1 Hour\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in English\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in 1 Hour\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in English\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in 1 Hour\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in English\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in 1 Hour\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in English\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in 1 Hour\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in English\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in 1 Hour\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in English\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in 1 Hour\n\n- 0\n\nHow to Write an Essay in",

    "In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of having a cell phone policy in schools. I will argue in favor of a policy that allows students to use their cell phones in class. I will state that this policy is beneficial as it is useful for both students and teachers.\n\nThe first advantage of having a cell phone policy that allows students to use their cell phones is that it is beneficial for students during class. For example, students can use their cell phones to search for the meaning of an unknown word in a book, or to search for the name of a particular plant in a book. Furthermore, students can use their cell phones to search for the meaning of an unknown word in a book, or to search for the name of a particular plant in a book.

    "Though facial expressions have been used to read emotions for ages, the modern era has brought a new way of reading emotions. Facial Action Coding system, also known as FACS, is a set of 46 universal facial expressions. By using FACS, one can tell what emotions a person is feeling by observing their facial expressions. In the school setting, this technology could be used to evaluate the emotions of students and teachers, which could help teachers better understand their students and help them learn more proficiently. However, this technology can also have a negative impact on student privacy, mental health, and academic performance. While FACS has the potential to be a beneficial tool in the classroom, it can also cause harm to students and teachers.\n\nFirst, FACS can be used to invade a student's privacy. It can be used to determine if a child is lying or not, which can lead to the child being punished for something they did not do. For example, a child could be accused of cheating on a test, even if they did not cheat. Or, a child could be accused of bullying a classmate, even if they did not bully that classmate. This could lead to the child being punished for something they did not do, which could cause them to lose confidence in themselves, which could lead to them having low self-esteem. Low self-esteem can lead to depression, which can have a negative impact on a child's mental health. Therefore, using FACS to determine if a student is lying or not could invade that student's privacy, which could have a negative impact on their mental health.\n\nSecond, FACS can be used to invade a teacher's privacy. It can be used to determine if a teacher is depressed or not, which can lead to the teacher losing their job. For example, a depressed teacher could be accused of being a poor teacher, even if they are not a poor teacher. This could lead to the teacher losing their job, which could cause them to lose confidence",
    "Cell phones have become a part of our life and it is almost impossible to imagine a life without mobile phone. However, with the increase in the number of users, the number of accidents have also increased. Using cell phone while driving is a major cause of road accidents. In this essay, I discuss the dangers of using cell phone while driving and discuss the measures that have been taken by some states to combat this issue.\n\nThe use of cell phone while driving has become a major cause of road accidents. It is found that the use of cell phone while driving is more dangerous than drinking and driving. According to a survey, the risk of a car accident is three times higher if the driver is using a cell phone. Using a cell phone while driving is distracting and it can be compared to a person driving while being drunk. The driver can not react quickly if there is an accident or any emergency situation. As a result, many drivers have been killed in road accidents caused by the distracted driving.\n\nThere are many measures that have been taken by the government to combat the issue of using cell phone while driving. In some states, using cell phone while driving is declared as a criminal offence. The drivers who have been caught using cell phone while driving have been fined and the license of the driver has also been cancelled. Some states have also banned the use of cell phone while driving. In some states, the drivers who have been caught using cell phone while driving have been asked to install a special device in their car. The device prevents the driver from using cell phone while driving. If the driver tries to use cell phone while driving, the device will stop the car and the driver has to pay a fine.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of cell phone while driving is a major cause of road accidents. The number of accidents can be reduced by taking necessary measures.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKamran\n\nLast edited by dumi; November 6, 2012 at 10:32 AM..

    "According to the 2016 presidential election results, the winning candidate, Donald Trump, won the election with 304 electoral votes, while his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won 227 electoral votes. This means that Trump was elected president with 53% of the electoral votes while Clinton was elected with 47% of the electoral votes. This is a very small difference, which could have caused a lot of controversy if the electoral college was not used in this election. The electoral college makes more sense than a popular vote because it prevents the winner from being determined by a few people in a few states, it prevents the candidate with the most votes from winning, and it gives small states an equal opportunity to be represented in the political process.\n\nThe electoral college makes more sense than a popular vote because it prevents the winner from being determined by a few people in a few states.

    "The benefits of seeking advice from multiple people rather than relying solely on one's own perspective when faced with a new or challenging situation can be summarized in the following points:\n\n- The perspective of multiple people provides a more comprehensive understanding of the situation.\n- The perspective of multiple people provides a more balanced perspective of the situation.\n- The perspective of multiple people provides a more objective perspective of the situation.\n\nA more comprehensive understanding of the situation is the first benefit of seeking advice from multiple people. While a single person may base their advice on their own experience and perspective, the advice of multiple people can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. For example, the perspective of a father may be different from the perspective of a son. Hence, the father may be able to offer the son advice on how to deal with a challenging situation, which the son may not be able to offer his father.\n\nThe second benefit of seeking advice from multiple people is that it provides a more balanced perspective of the situation. A single person may be biased towards one aspect of the situation, while the advice of multiple people may provide a more balanced perspective of the situation. For example, a father may be biased towards their son, while the advice of multiple people may provide a more balanced perspective of the son's situation.\n\nThe third benefit of seeking advice from multiple people is that it provides a more objective perspective of the situation. A single person may be biased towards a particular perspective of the situation, while the advice of multiple people may provide a more objective perspective of the situation. For example, a son may be biased towards their father, while the advice of multiple people may provide a more objective perspective of the father's situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of seeking advice from multiple people rather than relying solely on one's own perspective when faced with a new or challenging situation can be summarized in the following points: a more comprehensive understanding of the situation, a more balanced perspective of the situation, and a more objective perspective of the situation.\n\nThank you so much for your time and consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\nAlex\n\n3 September 2016 01:39\n\n- Report\n\nDear Alex,\n\nYou've made a good start on this essay, but it still needs a lot of work. For example, I think that you have the wrong idea about what the question is asking for. The question is not asking you to compare the advice of multiple people with the advice of one person. Instead, it is asking you to compare the benefits of seeking advice from multiple people with the benefits of relying solely on one's own perspective when faced with a new or challenging situation. To help you see the difference, here is the question again:\n\nExplain the benefits of seeking advice from multiple people rather than relying solely on one's own perspective when faced with a new or challenging situation. Use examples to support your argument.\n\nIn this case, the benefits of seeking advice from multiple people are compared with the benefits of relying solely on one's own perspective. In other words, you need to compare two different things, not two different types of advice.\n\nI've also noticed that you've made a mistake in your essay. The essay is about 760 words long, so it is longer than the word limit. However, that is not the mistake. The mistake is that you have written \"I kindly request you to compose an essay\". I don't know whether you are joking or whether you are serious. If you are serious, then I think that you need to work on your English. If you are joking, then I think that you need to work on your sense of humour.\n\nFinally, I would like to offer you a few suggestions for improving your essay. First, you need to explain your ideas clearly. For example, you need to explain what a \"comprehensive understanding\" is and you need to explain how a \"balanced perspective\" is different from an \"objective perspective\". Second, you need to use more examples. For example, you might like to think about what the parents of your friends might advise them. Third, you need to write more sentences.\n\nI hope that this helps you. Good luck with your studies.\n\nRegards,\n\nThe Write Site\n\nPlease log in or register to post comments.",
    "The present-day presidential election system in the United States of America is based on the electoral college. The candidates are voted by the electoral college who in turn are chosen by the people. The electoral college was formed to ensure that the candidates get a fair and unbiased vote from the people. However, the electoral college has failed to do so and needs to be abolished. This essay will argue that the electoral college be abolished in the United States presidential election system. The reasons for the argument will be discussed below.\n\nThe electoral college has failed to ensure that the people\u2019s votes are fair and unbiased. The electoral college is made up of members of the political parties. The members of the electoral college are chosen by the political parties and not by the people. Hence, the members of the electoral college are biased towards the political parties. They vote for the candidates of the political parties even if the candidate is not popular among the people. For example, in the presidential election in the year 2016, Donald Trump won the election even though he was not popular among the people. He only won because the electoral college voted for him even though he was not the popular choice among the people. This shows that the electoral college is biased and fails to give the people a fair and unbiased vote.\n\nIn the current election system, the winner of the presidential election is determined by the winner of the electoral college. Even if the candidate is not popular among the people, he can win the election if he wins the electoral college. This is not democratic. The candidate should win the election if he is popular among the people. For example, in the presidential election in the year 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote. But, George W. Bush won the electoral college. Hence, Al Gore lost the election even though he was more popular among the people. This is not democratic. The candidate who is more popular among the people should win the election. The system that is used in the United States presidential election system is not democratic. Therefore, the electoral college should be abolished in the United States presidential election system.\n\nThe electoral college is complicated and confusing. There are certain rules and regulations that need to be followed. For example, if there is a tie in the electoral college, the House of Representatives will decide the winner. This is a complicated process and it will take time to decide the winner. Hence, the electoral college should be abolished in the United States presidential election system.\n\nThe electoral college should be abolished in the United States presidential election system because it is not democratic. The candidate should win the election if he is popular among the people. The electoral college is complicated and confusing. It is also biased and fails to give the people a fair and unbiased vote.\n\nConclusion:\nTo conclude, the electoral college should be abolished in the United States presidential election system because it is not democratic. The candidate should win the election if he is popular among the people. The electoral college is complicated and confusing. It is also biased and fails to give the people a fair and unbiased vote.\n\nPlease kindly let me know if you have any queries or concerns.\n\nBest regards,\nXYZ\n\nRead more: https://www.englishforums.com/English/AbolishElectoralCollegeUSA/batxx/post.htm#ixzz6zJXk0Qdx\n\n- Read more...\n\n- 0 comments\n- 310 views\n\nHow to write a good essay \n\nBy Kiarra, October 18, 2020\n\nHow to write a good essay\n\nHow to write a good essay\n\nHow to write a good essay\n\nWriting an essay is a difficult task.

    "The Venusian surface is an extremely hostile environment, with temperatures reaching 450 degrees Celsius, pressures five times that of Earth, and a thick atmosphere consisting of 96% carbon dioxide. The author argues that these dangers do not outweigh the potential benefits of studying Venus, and that exploring the planet would increase our knowledge about our solar system. In my opinion, the author's argument is flawed because studying Venus presents both benefits and challenges, and exploring the planet would not significantly increase our knowledge about the solar system.\n\nThe author claims that studying Venus would provide benefits, such as understanding the effects of climate change and the potential for life on other planets. However, the author fails to acknowledge that studies have already been performed on the atmosphere and surface of Venus. In fact, the author's claim that exploring Venus would provide new knowledge is flawed because the planet has already been explored by both robotic and human missions. For example, the Soviet Union's Venera 7 and 9 were the first probes to land on Venus, and the NASA probes Pioneer 10 and 11 and the Venus Atmosphere Explorer have all provided significant data on the planet's atmosphere.\n\nThe author also suggests that exploring Venus would provide a significant contribution to our understanding of the solar system. However, this claim is also flawed because Venus is only the second planet from the Sun, and there are many other planets that have yet to be explored. For example, the surface of Mars has not yet been explored, and it is believed to have conditions that are similar to Earth. In addition, the author's suggestion that exploring Venus would provide new information on the solar system is flawed because the Sun is the most important planet in our solar system.\n\nIn conclusion, although the author claims that studying Venus presents both benefits and challenges, I believe that the author's argument is flawed because exploring Venus would not provide new knowledge about the solar system.\n\nTOEFL listening discussions: [What is the man doing?](english",
    "The Electoral College system is one of the most controversial topics in the United States, especially because of the election of Donald Trump in 2016, who lost the popular vote but won the electoral vote. There are many flaws in the current system which the American public has been dealing with for almost 250 years, the main one being that the candidate with the most votes does not necessarily win. In addition, the American public does not have a direct say in the election of the president, as the candidate who wins the popular vote can still lose the election. The current system also allows for an individual state of the United States to have more weight in the election than another state. Lastly, the Electoral College system is not as direct as the popular vote system, as the popular vote system is what the majority of the American public would prefer to have. Therefore, the Electoral College system is flawed and should be removed and replaced with a popular vote system, which would be more direct, fair, and democratic.\n\nThe Electoral College system has been used in the past to elect presidents, but it is not as direct as the popular vote system. In the popular vote system, the candidate with the most votes wins the election. However, the Electoral College system allows for a candidate to win the popular vote and still lose the election. This happened in the 2016 presidential election, as Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, but Donald Trump won the electoral vote. This is the flaw of the Electoral College system, as it allows for an individual state to have more weight in the election than another state. This is evident in the 2016 presidential election, as the electoral votes in the states of California and Texas (the two most populous states in the United States) were worth less than the electoral votes in the state of Wyoming (the least populous state in the United States). This means that the candidates had to focus on the swing states, which are the states that are evenly divided between the two major political parties in the United States, in order to win the election. This is evident in the 2016 presidential election, as Donald Trump won the election because he won the swing states of Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. This is not fair to the American public, as the candidates should focus on all 50 states, not just the swing states, in order to win the election. Therefore, the Electoral College system is flawed because the candidate with the most votes does not necessarily win.\n\nThe Electoral College system is not as direct as the popular vote system. The popular vote system is what the majority of the American public would prefer to have, as the candidate with the most votes wins the election. However, the Electoral College system is not as direct, as the candidate with the most votes can still lose the election. This happened in the 2016 presidential election, as Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, but Donald Trump won the electoral vote.

    "It is argued that schools should enforce students to engage in extracurricular activities. I completely agree with this idea and will argue that it is beneficial for students to participate in extracurricular activities. I will argue that they can provide experience in a particular activity, teach teamwork and communication skills, and facilitate the formation of friendships.\n\nFirstly, extracurricular activities can provide students experience in a specific activity. After a long day at school, students can join a variety of activities at their school or local community, they can learn how to play a musical instrument, how to dance, how to swim, or they can do many other things that they can do for fun. A good example of this is when I was a kid, I never had the chance to learn how to play any musical instruments but I wanted to learn how to play the guitar. I talked to my parents and they found a music school and I started to learn how to play the guitar and I was able to play the guitar when I was in high school and I was very proud of myself.\n\nSecondly, extracurricular activities can teach students teamwork and communication skills. In addition to learning a new skill, students can also learn how to work with others. For example, students can join a sports team or they can join a club, in this case, they need to communicate with others and they also need to work together to reach a common goal. For example, when I was in high school, I joined a basketball team and we participated in a lot of basketball games, during this time, I learned how to work with my teammates and I also learned how to communicate with my teammates. I found that it can be very beneficial in my future life.\n\nThirdly, extracurricular activities can help students to form friendships. When students engage in extracurricular activities, they have the chance to meet new people and make new friends. For example, I met my best friend when I was playing chess in a chess club. We played chess together for four years and we became best friends. In addition, we also joined a basketball team and we played basketball together for three years. We are still best friends until now and we are very happy.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that it is beneficial for students to participate in extracurricular activities. It can provide students with experience in a particular activity, teach teamwork and communication skills, and facilitate the formation of friendships. It will help students to be successful in their future life.\n\nPlease give me your feedback. Thank you very much in advance.\nanonymous: Looks good! You have a lot of ideas, but I think you need to work on your grammar and vocabulary. The sentences are short and choppy, and you use the same phrases over and over again. I",
    "The transportation sector is one of the greatest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, which is the main cause of climate change. The transportation sector is accountable for 25% of the total global emissions. The transport sector is responsible for 14% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions (Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, 2015). This is a significant figure as it is the same amount of emissions from the electricity sector. There is a need for more research to be done to determine the exact percentage of emissions from the transportation sector.\n\nThe type of transportation methods determines the amount of emissions that are produced. The transportation sector is divided into three categories, which are passenger transport, freight transport, and non-road transport. Passenger transport is the largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. This is because passenger transport includes cars, motorcycles, and buses. These vehicles are the most common transportation methods in the world, and they produce the most emissions. Freight transport is the second largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. This is because freight transport includes airplanes, ships, and trains. These vehicles are not common in most countries as they are more expensive to use. Non-road transport is the third largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. This is because non-road transport includes construction equipment, agricultural machinery, and forestry equipment (Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, 2015). These vehicles are not common in most countries as they are not used for transportation. The most common type of transportation in the world is passenger transport.

    "The United States has a unique way of electing its President. The United States is the only country that has a system of electing its President through the Electoral College. Due to this, the President is elected based on the popular vote. The Electoral College was created by the United States Constitution. The main purpose of the Electoral College is to ensure that the President's vote is not concentrated in one area of the country. When the Electoral College was created, the states were small and the country was not well connected. The Electoral College helped to make sure that the President was elected by all the states, not just a few big states. The Electoral College also ensures that the President is chosen by the people. This system prevents the President from focusing only on a certain area.\n\nThe Electoral College is beneficial in many ways.

    "Summer holidays are the most awaited period in the life of a student. The holidays are the time when students can relax and spend some time with their family. However, some people believe that summer projects should be assigned to students.\n\nI strongly agree with this idea. I believe that summer projects have many benefits. Firstly, summer projects help students to stay focused and motivated. They can spend some time thinking about their future and what they want to do in the future. For example, I have decided to continue my education after graduation, and this summer I have chosen to write my college essay, so that I can apply for college in the fall. Secondly, summer projects can help students to improve their skills. For example, if a student wants to learn how to write code, then he can do a summer project in that field. This way, he will learn how to code and improve his skills.\n\nOn the other hand, some people believe that summer projects are not necessary, as students spend most of their time having fun with their friends. They say that summer projects can be a distraction from the fun time they spend with their friends.\n\nHowever, I believe that students should be required to do summer projects because they have many benefits. Firstly, students can spend the time learning new skills and improving their skills. Secondly, summer projects can help them to stay focused and motivated. Finally, summer projects can help them to find their future career path.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that summer projects are beneficial to students. Therefore, I strongly believe that students should be required to do summer projects over the summer break.\n\nSubmit your essay for review\n\nYou may also find useful\n\n- Essay on whether it is better to work alone or in a team\n- Essay on whether the internet has made the world smaller\n- Essay on whether the internet is making people less social\n- Essay on whether people should be allowed to keep exotic animals as pets\n\nTestimonials\n\nOur customers' testimonials prove we're doing everything right.\n\nJulie\n\nCharlotte\n\nNick\n\n- Read more testimonials\n\nFAQ\n\nFrequently asked questions about our services.\n\n- Read more FAQs",

    "\u201cShould students be allowed to have cell phones in school?\u201d\nIn my opinion, students should not be allowed to have cell phones in school. There are various reasons for this, such as the lack of focus on their studies and the distraction it creates. I will explain this in detail below.\nFirst of all, the distraction it creates is one of the main reasons why students should not be allowed to have cell phones in school. The reason is that the student will be tempted to use the cell phone in class, which will distract him/her from the teacher\u2019s lecture. This can lead to a bad grade in the end. As a result, the student will not be able to concentrate on his/her studies and will not be able to focus on learning. Furthermore, if the student uses the cell phone in class, he/she will not be able to learn anything new. This means that he/she will not be able to learn new concepts, which will make it harder for him/her to succeed in the future.\nOn the other hand, it can be argued that students should be allowed to have cell phones in school, as they can use them to contact their parents in case of an emergency. However, this argument is not valid because there are other ways to contact their parents in case of an emergency, such as using the school\u2019s telephone or calling 911. Furthermore, having cell phones in school can also be dangerous because students may use them to bully other students or cheat",
    "While there are many pros to using cell phones while driving, the cons outweigh them. The dangers of using cell phones while driving are enormous and can cause accidents and even death. The statistics show that accidents caused by cell phone usage while driving are increasing. It is up to us to make the right decision and not use our phones while driving. We must be responsible for our own actions.\n\nThere are many pros to using cell phones while driving. First of all, some people need to use their phones while driving because they are doctors or police officers. They have to be in touch with their patients, their colleagues, or the police department. If they cannot use their phones while driving, they would have to pull over. This would be inconvenient and could lead to a problem. Second of all, some people use their phones while driving to be safe. They tend to use their phones while driving in order to use their GPS. This allows them to get to their destinations faster and safer. Third of all, some people use their phones while driving to be entertained. They may use their phones while driving to listen to music, read a book, or even watch a movie. This allows them to be entertained while driving, which is also a positive thing.\n\nHowever, the cons to using cell phones while driving are enormous. First of all, the statistics show that using cell phones while driving is increasing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cIn 2013, 3,154 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver, and an estimated additional 424,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver\u201d (CDC). This shows that the number of accidents caused by cell phone usage while driving is increasing. Second of all, many people do not need to use their phones while driving. They use their phones for pleasure and entertainment. This is not a reason to use their phones while driving. Third of all, it is dangerous to use cell phones while driving. People have a tendency to take their eyes off the road. This can cause them to miss stop signs, pedestrians, and even other cars. It can cause accidents and even death.\n\nAll in all, we must make the right decision. We must be responsible for our actions. We must not use our phones while driving. We must be in control of our lives. We must pay attention to our surroundings. It is up to us to make a change in the world. It is up to us to be safe.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nThank you",
    "In the United States, the President is elected by the Electoral College. This system is a form of indirect election. The Electoral College is a system in which the President is elected by a group of people, called electors, who are elected by the citizens of the United States. The Electoral College is a compromise between electing the President directly and electing the President by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Each state has as many electors as it has Senators and Representatives in Congress. The District of Columbia has three electors. The 23rd Amendment of the Constitution granted the District of Columbia three electors. The electors meet in their respective state capitals and cast their votes for President and Vice President. The Electors vote for President and Vice President on separate ballots. The Electors vote for President on the ballot of the political party for which they are pledged and for Vice President on a separate ballot. The Electors vote for President and Vice President on the same day. The electors vote for President and Vice President, but the votes are not counted until December 15. The votes are counted by the President of the Senate, who is the Vice President. The Congress meets in joint session on January 6 to count the electoral votes. The candidate that gets a majority of the electoral votes is elected President. The candidate that gets a majority of the electoral votes is elected Vice President. The Constitution requires a President and Vice President that are of different parties. If no candidate gets a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives elects the President from the three candidates that received the most electoral votes.

    "To begin with, I believe that when faced with a problem it is always better to seek advice from multiple sources before making a decision. I will illustrate this by using examples of my own experiences in which I had to make important decisions and sought advice from multiple sources.\n\nFirstly, when I was in high school I had to make a decision about which university I wanted to go to. I had already made up my mind about the country I wanted to study in, but I had a lot of questions regarding the university I had in mind. I decided to seek advice from my parents, my teachers and my friends. I first talked to my parents who were very experienced and wise. They advised me to visit the university and make my own decision. I also sought advice from my teachers who had already studied in the same university. They told me that the university was a very good one and I should not think twice about going there. Finally, I decided to talk to some of my friends who were already studying in the university. They were very happy with their choice and told me that the university was very good.\n\nSecondly, I had to make a decision about which job to take when I graduated from university. I decided to seek advice from my parents, friends and teachers. I first talked to my parents who advised me to take a job in a company that had a good reputation. I also talked to my friends who had graduated from university before me. They told me that they were happy with their job and they advised me to take a job in the same company. Finally, I talked to my teachers",
    "Technology has become an integral part of our lives and has been changing the way we live. However, it is not always good news. The introduction of automatic technology in our world has its benefits but also has disadvantages. I will discuss the potential drawbacks of automatic technology in our world, using the example of driverless cars as a case study. I will compare and contrast the benefits and drawbacks of human-driven cars versus self-driving cars, and argue for or against the adoption of driverless cars in society.\n\nThe first drawback of automatic technology is the extra cost. Driverless cars are a lot more expensive than normal cars. They have to go through a lot of safety tests before they are ready for the market. These tests are costly and are passed on to the consumer. The extra cost makes it difficult for the lower-income group to afford them.\n\nAnother drawback is the complicated maintenance. An automatic car has more sensors and mechanical parts than a normal car. Therefore, it is more prone to breakdowns and requires more maintenance. This makes it difficult for the owner to maintain the car. It is difficult for the owner to find a mechanic to fix the car. Therefore, it is difficult for the owner to maintain the car. It is difficult for the owner to find a mechanic to fix the car. Therefore, it is difficult for the owner to maintain the car.\n\nThere are also safety hazards associated with them. Automatic cars do not have a driver who can take control of the car in case of an emergency. This makes them more prone to accidents. They also do not have a driver who can take control of the car in case of an emergency. This makes them more prone to accidents. They also do not have a driver who can take control of the car in case of an emergency. This makes them more prone to accidents.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, automatic cars have a lot of benefits. They are more efficient and consume less fuel than human-driven cars. They also reduce the number of accidents on the road. They also reduce the number of accidents on the road.\n\nThe benefits of automatic cars outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, I believe that automatic cars are a good thing and should be adopted in society.\n\nWhat do you think about this essay?

Your sentences are too short, and your paragraphs too long. You need to vary your sentence length to make your writing more interesting. You also need to vary the length of your paragraphs, too. A good paragraph should be no longer than five sentences.\n\nSecond, you need to improve your word choice.

    "The United States is one of the countries that use the electoral college system for electing the president. According to the electoral college rules, every state gets a certain number of electors, which are equal to the number of senators and representatives in the state. The electors of a state vote for the presidential candidate, and the candidate with the highest number of votes wins the election. The electoral college system has both advantages and disadvantages.\n\nOne of the advantages of the electoral college system is that it prevents the election of a president with the least number of votes. In the United States, the candidates are required to get at least 270 electoral votes to win the election. In case no presidential candidate gets 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives votes to elect the president. This is a major advantage because it prevents the election of a president with the least number of votes. This is unlike the popular vote system where the candidate with the least number of votes wins the election (Hill, 2016).\n\nAnother advantage of the electoral college system is that it facilitates representation of small states. In the electoral college system, each state has a certain number of electors. This means that the presidential candidates have to campaign in all the states because they need to get the votes of the electors in every state. This gives the small states a chance to get their candidates to the White House (Hill, 2016).\n\nHowever, the electoral college system also has its disadvantages. One of the disadvantages is that it limits the popular vote. In the United States, the presidential candidates are required to get at least 270 electoral votes to win the election. This means that the presidential candidates can ignore the popular vote and concentrate on the states that have electors. This is unlike the popular vote system where the candidates are required to get the most number of votes from the citizens (Hill, 2016).\n\nAnother disadvantage of the electoral college system is that it is not transparent. This is because the electors of a state have the power to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice even after they have been elected by the citizens. This means that the electors can vote for a candidate based on their personal interests. This is unlike the popular vote system where the citizens directly vote for the presidential candidates and the candidates with the most votes become the president (Hill, 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, the electoral college system has both advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages of the electoral college system include the representation of small states and prevention of the election of the candidate with the least number of votes. Some of the disadvantages of the electoral college system include the limitation of the popular vote and the lack of transparency. However, the electoral college system is still in use in the United States because it has more advantages than disadvantages.\n\nReferences\n\nHill, J. (2016).

    "The U.S. electoral college system is in many ways a mystery to Americans and foreigners alike. The electoral college is a system of voting used to elect the president of the United States. This system has been in place since the first U.S. presidential election in 1789.\n\nThe electoral college is comprised of 538 electors, and in order to win the presidency, a candidate must receive a majority of 270 electoral votes. The number of electors from each state is equal to the number of members in the House of Representatives plus the two senators each state has. The number of electors each state has is determined by its population.\n\nThe electoral college system has many advantages and disadvantages. One advantage of the system is that it gives smaller, less populated states a greater voice than a popular vote would. Another advantage is that it gives political parties more power than a popular vote would.\n\nOne major disadvantage of the electoral college system is that there is no guarantee that the candidate who wins the most popular votes will be the winner of the presidential election. This has occurred twice in U.S. history, in the 2000 presidential election and the 2016 presidential election. In both cases, the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. This has led to calls by many people for the electoral college to be abolished.\n\nIn conclusion, the electoral college system has many advantages and disadvantages. It has been an important part of U.S. history for over 200 years, and will probably be around for many more years to come.\n\nAuthor: Alexander\n\nThis essay was submitted to us by a student in order to help you with your studies.\n\nIf you use part of this page in your own work, you need to provide a citation, as follows:\n\nEssay Sauce, .

    "The majority of people think that driveless cars should be developed because they would make driving safer and more convenient. However, in my opinion, the development of driveless cars is not desirable. I would like to explain my view point with the following evidences from the text.\n\nFirst, the author states that \u201cthe use of driveless cars may cause road accidents\u201d. This statement is supported by evidence from the text. In the text, the author says that \u201cDriverless cars do not have the ability to react to sudden situations\u201d. This means that a driverless car will not be able to react to sudden and unexpected situations such as the car in front of it stopping suddenly or the driver in front of it swerving. In addition, the author says that \u201cthe car may not be able to recognise pedestrians crossing the road\u201d. This is a big problem because it means that the car could hit a pedestrian. This means that the use of driveless cars may cause road accidents.\n\nSecond, the author states that the use of driveless cars will make driving more convenient. This statement is supported by evidence from the text. In the text, the author says that \u201cthe car can drive itself to the destination\u201d. This means that people will not have to drive their car. This means that they will be able to do other things while they are on the way to their destination. However, in my opinion, this is not desirable. The reason is that people will not be able to drive their own cars and they will lose many driving skills. For example, they will not be able to make decisions quickly and they will not be able to handle sudden situations. This means that they will not be safe drivers.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that driveless cars should not be developed because they may cause road accidents and they will make driving less convenient. I would like to conclude my essay with a quotation from the text, \u201cDriveless cars may cause road accidents\u201d.\n\nI hope that you will agree with my view point.\n\nYours sincerely,\nSakura\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nThank you.\n\nSakura\n\n9 Comments\n\nRashmi on November 20, 2018 at 12:46 am \n\nHello teacher,\nI wrote this letter to my friend about my new job.

    "The Seagoing Cowboys program is a government-funded program that allows American cattle ranchers to ship their cattle to countries where there is a shortage of beef. This is done by sending American cattle ranchers on a ship, where they will help the other crew members take care of the cattle during the journey. The cattle will then be shipped to the other country, where the cattle ranchers will be paid in return for their services. I was invited to join the Seagoing Cowboys program after I had graduated from college. I had just started working, and I wanted to travel the world. I decided to apply for the program, and I was accepted. Before the ship arrived, I had to make sure that I had all the documents that were required. I also had to prepare myself for the journey, as I had never been on a ship before. The journey took five days, and during that time I helped the other crew members take care of the cattle. It was a very interesting experience, and I was able to learn a lot about the cattle ranching industry. I also learned about the different cultures that I met on the ship. One of the biggest challenges I faced during the program was language barrier. Most of the people on the ship spoke Spanish, and I only knew a little Spanish. However, I was able to communicate with them through gestures and other means, and I was able to understand most of them. The impact of the program on me was that it made me realize that I wanted to travel the world. The impact of the program on the people I helped was that they were able to get beef that they would not have otherwise been able to get. This program has shaped my future by making me realize that I want to travel the world and help people.\n\nyurikazuky 2018-04-10 04:32:34 UTC #2\n\nWould you mind to share your essay?

    "The \"Face\" on Mars is believed to be a natural landform and not created by aliens, for the following reasons. Firstly, the face is located between two canyons, and it is very likely that it is a landform that has been carved by erosion. Secondly, the face is in the shape of a human face, and it is very likely that it is a natural landform that has been shaped by erosion. Thirdly, the face has a number of details, such as the eye sockets, nose and mouth, and it is very likely that these details are natural landforms that have been shaped by erosion. Fourthly, the face is very large, measuring 1.5 miles long and 0.75 miles wide, and it is very likely that it is a natural landform that has been shaped by erosion. Finally, the face has pointed ears, and it is very likely that it is a natural landform that has been shaped by erosion.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Face\" on Mars is believed to be a natural landform and not created by aliens, for the reasons given above.

    "There are many benefits of seeking advice from multiple sources when making a decision. In my opinion, the most important of them all is that it helps to ensure that the decision is well thought out and that it is correct. Another reason is that it helps to ensure that the decision is not biased. The third reason is that it helps to ensure that the decision is in line with the values and beliefs of the person who is making the decision.\n\nTo begin with, when people seek advice from multiple sources, they are more likely to come to a well thought out decision. This is because they take the time to carefully listen to each piece of advice that is given to them and to consider it. This means that they are less likely to make a decision without considering all of their options. If this was not the case, there would be a greater chance that the decision would be incorrect.\n\nSecondly, when people seek advice from multiple sources, they are less likely to be biased in the decision that they make. This is because they are more likely to listen to the advice of others who do not have a vested interest in the decision. For example, if I was purchasing a new car, it would not be in my best interest to ask my mother to give me advice about the purchase. This is because she would be extremely biased in the advice that she gave me. However, it would be in my best interest to seek advice from a variety of sources.\n\nThirdly, when people seek advice from multiple sources, they are more likely to be in line with their values and beliefs. This is because they are more likely to seek advice from people who share the same values and beliefs as they do. For example, if I was making a decision that would impact the environment, it would be in my best interest to seek advice from a variety of sources. This is because I would be more likely to be in line with my values and beliefs.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many benefits of seeking advice from multiple sources when making a decision. The most important of them all is that it helps to ensure that the decision is well thought out and that it is correct. Another reason is that it helps to ensure that the decision is not biased. The third reason is that it helps to ensure that the decision is in line with the values and beliefs of the person who is making the decision.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\n- Essay on the topic: It is better to be a part of a team rather than to be a leader\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on the topic: We should not use animals for experiments\n- Essay on",
    "Introduction: The Face on Mars is a mysterious and enigmatic feature of the planet Mars. This essay will discuss the validity of the claim that the face on Mars is proof of alien life on the planet. This will be achieved by considering the effectiveness of carving a giant face as a means of communication, the possibility of alternative methods of communication, the lack of footprints or other evidence of construction, and the human tendency to believe in supernatural stories.\n\nBody:\nThe first factor to be considered is the effectiveness of carving a giant face as a means of communication. It seems far more likely that the face was carved as a feature of a landscape to be admired, as opposed to a means of communication. After all, there is no evidence that the face has been used as a way for alien spacecraft to navigate the planet, or to indicate a specific location. In fact, the face is so far from other features of interest on the planet that it is unlikely to have been carved for the purpose of communication. For example, if the face was used as a means of communication, it would be more likely to be located near the Canals, or the Olympus Mons, or near the Martian ice caps, rather than in the middle of nowhere. The face seems to be a natural feature of the landscape, rather than a man-made feature. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the face was carved as a means of communication.\n\nThe second factor to be considered is the possibility of alternative methods of communication. As mentioned above, it seems far more likely that the face was carved as a feature of a landscape to be admired, as opposed to a means of communication. In other words, it seems far more likely that the face was carved for the purpose of aesthetics, rather than communication. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the face was carved as a means of communication.\n\nThe third factor to be considered is the lack of footprints or other evidence of construction. As mentioned above, it seems far more likely that the face was carved as a feature of a landscape to be admired, as opposed to a means of communication. In other words, it seems far more likely that the face was carved for the purpose of aesthetics, rather than communication. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the face was carved as a means of",
    "The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is planning to explore Venus by sending a blimp-like vehicle called the Venus Balloon Explorer for Radiation-belt Relativistic Electron Losses (VERBREL). VERBREL will be launched on a Delta II rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in October 2015. The 45-day mission will cost the United States government $24 million. The VERBREL is a balloon-shaped craft made of a thin plastic film. It will be inflated to 10 m in diameter with helium gas. It will float in the atmosphere of Venus, which is 55 km above the surface. The balloon will be equipped with a radio transmitter and a camera. The objective of the mission is to measure the electric field and the density of the plasma in the Venus atmosphere, which will help scientists investigate the magnetic field of Venus. Scientists hope to gain a better understanding of how planets are formed and how their atmospheres are maintained.\n\nThe main challenge of the mission is that the atmosphere of Venus is toxic. The dense atmosphere is composed of 96 percent carbon dioxide. The temperature at the surface is 500 \u00b0C, which is hot enough to melt lead. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is 92 times higher than that on Earth. The blimp will not be able to carry a large payload. The electric field and the density of the plasma will be measured by the NASA's VERBREL. It is possible that the blimp will break up under the extreme atmospheric pressure. The blimp will be equipped with a radio transmitter and a camera. However, the blimp is not designed to transmit high-resolution images. The mission will also require a large number of people to operate. The blimp will be launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in October 2015. It will take about 45 days to complete the mission.\n\nThe mission is worth the investment of time, money and human lives. The Venus Balloon Explorer for Radiation",

    "Cowboys are known for their tough lifestyle and hard work. The most unique of cowboys are the seagoing cowboys, whose job entails caring for livestock and sightseeing in Europe. In this essay, I will describe the unique job of a seagoing cowboy and explain why someone might be interested in pursuing this opportunity.\n\nA seagoing cowboy is responsible for caring for livestock on a ship while maneuvering around the world. Although this job sounds simple, it requires a lot of hard work. For instance, the cowboy has to take care of the livestock, which includes feeding, cleaning, and giving them water. Additionally, the cowboy has to take care of the ship, which includes cleaning and repairing the ship. Lastly, the cowboy has to take care of himself, which includes cleaning and exercising. Besides hard work, the cowboy has to be aware of the cowboys around him and alert for any potential threats.

    "The desire to travel and to experience different cultures is a common desire for many people. However, the decision to travel can be a difficult one to make, as it can involve many financial and logistical challenges. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why Luke joined the seagoing cowboys and the challenges he faced as the only person from his town to do so. I will then evaluate the benefits of joining the seagoing cowboys, including the opportunity to travel to different places, meet new people, and experience different cultures. Finally, I will analyze the impact of Luke's work as a seagoing cowboy, including his trip to China and the delivery of mules, horses, and cows to the local population, and I will discuss the importance of his experiences.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that Luke had a strong desire to travel and to experience different cultures. As a result, he decided to join the seagoing cowboys, a group of people who traveled by boat to different places and delivered animals to local populations.

    "The summer break is a time of rest and relaxation for students, but it can also be a time of learning. As an educator, I have found that creating teacher-designed projects during the summer can be an excellent way to keep students engaged in the learning process. With a teacher-designed project, I can set clear expectations, assess student progress, and provide students with the benefit of a teacher\u2019s expertise. In contrast, student-designed projects can be difficult to assess and often lack structure, which can make them less beneficial for students. In addition, a student-designed project is often more difficult for a teacher to assess and requires more planning on the part of the teacher.\n\nWith teacher-designed projects, I can set clear expectations and provide students with a structure that will help them stay on track during the summer. For example, I can set a goal for students to complete a certain number of pages of a book over the summer. I can also provide them with a list of books to choose from, or a list of books that I think would be good for them to read. Then, I can provide them with a rubric that specifies what they should include in their report, how much time they have to complete it, and what the final grade should be. This structure helps students stay on track and make progress toward the goal.\n\nIn contrast, student-designed projects are often difficult for teachers to assess and can lack structure. For example, if a student decides to write a book report over the summer, how do I know if they are doing it correctly? What if they choose a book that I think is too advanced for them? How do I know if they are actually reading the book, or if they are just skimming the pages? Without a structure, it is difficult for teachers to assess student work and provide feedback. In addition, student-designed projects often lack structure because students do not have the expertise that teachers have. This can make it difficult for teachers to provide students with the guidance they need to succeed.\n\nIn addition, a student-designed project is often more difficult for a teacher to assess and requires more planning on the part of the teacher. For example, if a student decides to write a book report over the summer, how do I know if they are doing it correctly? What if they choose a book that I think is too advanced for them? How do I know if they are actually reading the book, or if they are just skimming the pages? Without a structure, it is difficult for teachers to assess student work and provide feedback. In addition, student-designed projects often lack structure because students do not have the expertise that teachers have. This can make it difficult for teachers to provide students with the guidance they need to succeed.\n\nOverall, I believe that teacher-designed projects have many benefits for students. They allow teachers to set clear expectations for students and provide them with a structure that helps them stay on track. In addition, it is easier for teachers to assess student work and provide feedback. Finally, teacher-designed projects often provide students with the expertise that they need to succeed.\n\nIt is not a good idea to use the first person in an academic essay.

He argues that there are many people who do not have access to cars and trucks, and that these people will not be able to access driverless cars and trucks. He argues that this will be a problem because it will leave some people behind.

    "Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the use of online classes. This trend is mainly due to the fact that online classes are convenient and help learners to save time. In addition, online classes are accessible from anywhere. However, there are several drawbacks, such as lack of interaction between teacher and students. This essay will discuss the benefits of online classes and also mention the drawbacks of online classes.\n\nFirst and foremost, online classes are convenient and help learners to save time. For example, students do not have to travel to a specific location to attend a class. There are numerous online classes available on the internet. Therefore, students can attend these classes from the comfort of their homes. In addition, students can attend these classes at their own pace. This allows learners to ask questions and get instant feedback from the instructor. Online classes are also beneficial as they allow students to attend classes from anywhere. For instance, students can attend their classes while traveling or while taking a break from their jobs.\n\nHowever, there are several drawbacks of attending online classes from home. One of the drawbacks of online classes is that learners may not be able to understand the lectures or assignments. This is because students may not be able to interact with the instructor during the classes. Moreover, students may not be able to ask questions during the classes and may not receive instant feedback. In addition, online classes are not suitable for students who do not have access to the internet. Therefore, students have to attend classes in a specific location.\n\nIn conclusion, online classes are convenient and help students to save time.

    "As the world is rapidly becoming more technologically advanced, it is not surprising that the education system has changed dramatically in recent years. I would like to discuss the potential benefits of home-based learning programs, and evaluate the challenges we may face in the future.\nThe first and most important benefit of home-based learning is that students can learn at their own pace. In other words, each student can easily focus on topics they are interested in, and spend more time on topics they are not interested in. The second benefit is that students can avoid distractions and interruptions in the classroom. In other words, they can focus on learning without worrying about their friends, teachers and classmates. In addition, students can have one-on-one time with teachers, which is very important for students who want to ask questions. Finally, home-based learning can also help parents who are worried about their child's safety and well-being in a school environment. In other words, parents can monitor their children's study and protect them from potential dangers.\nThe challenges of home-based learning include the potential impact on student anxiety and pressure, as well as the potential benefits for parents concerned about their child's safety and well-being in a school environment. First of all, home-based learning can increase student anxiety and pressure, because they may be worried about the lack of interaction with their classmates and teachers. It is very important that students have interaction with their classmates and teachers, because it is a way to relieve stress and pressure. Another challenge is that parents may be concerned about their child's safety and well-being in a school environment. For example, some students may be bullied in school and be afraid to go to school. It is very important that students feel safe and comfortable in a school environment, so that they can easily learn and focus on their studies.\nIn conclusion, home-based learning can have a positive impact on students, including the ability to learn at their own pace, avoid distractions and interruptions, and have one-on-one time with teachers. However, we may face some challenges in the future, such as student anxiety and pressure, as well as the potential benefits for parents concerned about their child's safety and well-being in a school environment. In my opinion, we should monitor home-based learning programs in the future to ensure that they are beneficial for students and teachers.\n\nWord count: 444\n\nThank you so much for your time, help and effort.\n\nBest regards,\nJames\n\nLast edited by JamesBurgess on 04 Feb 2021, 14:56, edited 1 time in total.\n\nRe: JamesBurgess - 04 Feb 2021, 14",
    "Driverless cars are vehicles that are driven by electronic systems. Driverless cars are thought to be the future of transportation. In the article \u201cDriverless cars: The future of road safety?\u201d written by Priyanka Mogul, the author talks about the benefits of driverless cars, the drawbacks of driverless cars and the benefits of driverless cars for the society and the economy. Most people think that driverless cars are not safe and that they are dangerous. I believe that driverless cars will help to improve the safety of driving, reduce gas consumption and increase people\u2019s awareness of their surroundings.\n\nFirstly, driverless cars can help to improve the safety of driving. In the article, the author states that \u201cdriverless cars can help to reduce the number of accidents\u201d because they can provide a much more accurate read of the surrounding conditions, and they can provide a more accurate read of the road conditions. For example, a driverless car can tell whether the road is wet or dry, and it can tell whether the road is slippery or not. Also, a driverless car can tell whether the road is icy or not. Also, driverless cars can help to reduce the number of accidents because they can provide a much more accurate read of the surrounding conditions, and they can provide a much more accurate read of the road conditions.\n\nSecondly, driverless cars can help to reduce gas consumption. In the article, the author states that \u201cdriverless cars can help to reduce gas consumption because they can provide a much more accurate read of the surrounding conditions, and they can provide a much more accurate read of the road conditions.\u201d For example, a driverless car can tell whether the road is wet or dry, and it can tell whether the road is slippery or not. Also, a driverless car can tell whether the road is icy or not. Also, driverless cars can help to reduce gas consumption because they can provide a much more accurate read of the surrounding conditions, and they can provide a much more accurate read of the road conditions.\n\nThirdly, driverless cars can help to increase people\u2019s awareness of their surroundings.

    "Driverless cars are a new concept that is being developed by many companies, and they have the potential to change the way in which we travel. This essay will outline the history of driverless cars, including the first concept car created by General Motors in the late 1950s and the current technology used by companies such as Tesla and Google. It will also discuss the potential benefits of driverless cars, such as reducing the number of accidents caused by human error, and the challenges that must be overcome, such as changes to traffic laws and liability issues.\n\nIn the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car with a fully automated driving system. This concept car was called the Firebird II and was manufactured by a company called Hughes Electronics. Since then, many other companies have developed driverless car technology, such as Google and Tesla.\n\nThe benefits of driverless cars are that they could reduce the number of accidents caused by human error and could save thousands of lives every year. In addition, they are environmentally friendly, as they use less petrol than cars driven manually. However, there are many challenges that must be overcome before driverless cars can be widely adopted. For example, traffic laws would need to be changed to accommodate driverless cars, and liability issues would need to be addressed. In addition, there is currently no legislation regarding driverless cars in many countries, so any accidents caused by these cars would need to be investigated by the police.\n\nIn conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to change the way in which we travel, but there are many challenges that must be overcome before they can be widely adopted.",
    "The benefits of driverless cars are numerous. Firstly, it is safer for people to be driven by a computer than by a human. This is because computers do not get tired or distracted by mobile phones and other factors. In addition, it is safer for the environment as people do not need to use petrol and diesel to travel. Furthermore, it is able to be used by people with disabilities. Nowadays, people with disabilities are not able to drive themselves due to their disabilities. If driverless cars are available, they could easily go where they want to go. Finally, driverless cars are able to be used by people who are not able to drive. This would be very beneficial for people who live in rural areas as they could easily get to where they need to go.\n\nIn contrast, driverless cars have the potential to cause many problems. Firstly, they could be hacked by criminals and drive people to a place with dangerous people. Also, accidents could occur as the driverless cars have no human interactions. Finally, there is no way to tell if the car is safe or not. This is because there is no driver to check the car\u2019s safety.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the disadvantages. They are able to be used by everyone and are safer than human drivers.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\nKind regards,\nSaidatul\nAnswers \n\nAnswer #1\n\nDear Saidatul,\n\nHope you are doing well.\n\nI have gone through your essay and found it to be very well written. You have covered all the points that you had to. There is no need to worry about the word limit, as long as you have written everything that you had to, it is good enough. The only thing that I would like to point out is that the word \u2018self-driving\u2019 is used a lot. Try to use other words like \u2018automated\u2019 or \u2018driverless\u2019 instead of \u2018self-driving\u2019. This will help you to vary your vocabulary. Also, try to use more synonyms for the word \u2018better\u2019. You have used the word \u2018better\u2019 a lot in your essay. So try to use synonyms like \u2018more convenient\u2019, \u2018more efficient\u2019, \u2018less risky\u2019 and so on. This will help you to vary your vocabulary.\n\nI would give you a score of 7.5 out of 10 for this essay.\n\nGood luck.\n\nRegards,\n\nManish\n\nMy name is Manish and I am an IELTS Trainer with 9 years",

He was a leader and he tried to convince his fellow missionaries to join the mission program. His experiences on board the trip influenced his perspective because he had seen many things on board the ship that made him more mature and made him think about what he was doing. The first experience that made him more mature was when he saw a dead body floating in the water. The body was a baby that had died of hunger. This experience made him think about his own life and about the lives of others. He was very lucky to be born in a rich family and he understood that not all people were as lucky as he was. Another experience that made him mature was when he discovered that the captain of the ship was a very bad man. He was stealing money from the passengers and he was very greedy. This experience made him think about the captain and it made him realize that he was not a very good man.

    "Cell phones are devices which help people to communicate with each other from different places. Therefore, the use of cell phones in school is one of the most controversial issues in the world. Students and teachers have different opinions about the issue. However, the use of cell phones in school should be restricted in order to improve the academic performance of students and to prevent the use of cell phones during class time.\n\nFirst of all, the use of cell phones in school can help students to improve their academic performance. For example, students use their cell phones to search for information about their homework. As a result, they save time and can use that time to study. Moreover, students who use their cell phones to send messages to their friends during class time can study the subject which is being discussed in class. As a result, they can improve their academic performance.\n\nOn the other hand, the use of cell phones in school can cause many negative consequences. For example, students who use their cell phones to send messages during class time do not pay attention to their teachers. As a result, they can not understand the subject which is being discussed in class and their academic performance decreases. Moreover, students use their cell phones to send messages to their friends during class time. As a result, they can not concentrate on the subject which is being discussed in class and their academic performance decreases.\n\nTo sum up, the use of cell phones in school should be restricted in order to improve the academic performance of students and to prevent the use of cell phones during class time.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nFebruary 18, 2014 at 8:40 AM \n\nHi evryone, i am a new member. i want to get good score in ielts writing module. please help me.\n\n",

    "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a method of analyzing the human face and facial expressions. Facial expressions are a form of nonverbal communication that is used to express emotion. The FACS system was developed in 1978 by Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen. This system is used to analyze the different facial movements that are used to produce different emotions. The FACS system breaks down facial movements into 44 different categories, 12 of which express emotions (Ekman, 2014). The FACS system is a measure of facial muscle movements, not of the cognitive processes that produce them. This system can be used in the classroom setting to analyze facial expressions for signs of confusion or disinterest. This system can also be used to modify lessons to better suit individual student needs. The FACS system can be used to teach drama students about facial expressions, and how they can be used to produce emotions. The FACS system can be used to help students understand how their facial expressions can affect their ability to communicate. The FACS system can also be used to analyze the facial expressions of teachers, which can be used to improve communication between teachers and students.\n\nThe FACS system can be used in the classroom setting to analyze facial expressions for signs of confusion or disinterest.

    "As the population of the world is increasing, the pressure on the government to provide basic amenities is increasing. One of the ways to reduce this pressure is to make children do work for the public. It is a good idea to make children do community service in order to build up their work ethics and to be socially responsible. However, this can be done only in some countries. I will elaborate on this in my essay.\n\nFirst of all, I think that children should have some kind of mandatory community service in order to teach them to be responsible and to help the society. For example, in my country, children are required to do community service during their holidays. In addition to this, the schools help them to find a place for community service. The children work in the local markets, factories, government offices and so on. In this way, they are taught to be responsible and to help others. This is a good idea.\n\nHowever, there are some countries where this cannot be done. For instance, in my country, people are too poor to do community service. In addition to this, there are many things that children learn from school. For example, they learn mathematics, science and so on. Therefore, I think that it is not a good idea to force children to do community service.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that the children should do community service in order to learn some social values. However, it should be done in some countries and not in all countries. It is a good idea to do community service.\n\nThanks for reading this and helping me.

    "The American presidential election process is very complex. The 2016 presidential election is a good example, as it has been a very unusual campaign. There are two main candidates, and the top two vote-getters are Donald Trump (Republican) and Hillary Clinton (Democratic). However, neither candidate has received a majority of the votes. In fact, Hillary Clinton has received more votes than Donald Trump, but she has not received the necessary 270 electoral votes to win the election. The electoral college system is partially to blame.\n\nThe electoral college system was created in 1787 when the United States Constitution was ratified. It was designed to give greater influence to smaller states, which would otherwise be dominated by large states. Each state has a number of electors equal to the number of members of Congress it has. Each elector casts one vote for the candidate of his or her choice. The candidate who receives a majority of votes in a state receives all of the state\u2019s electoral votes. It is possible for the candidate who receives the most votes in a state to win all of the state\u2019s electoral votes. This is what happened in 2000 when George W. Bush defeated Al Gore. Bush received 271 electoral votes and Gore received 266. However, Gore won the popular vote. The United States is the only country in the world that uses an electoral college system.\n\nThe electoral college system has its advantages. It allows voters to cast their vote for their candidate of choice. It is also possible for the candidate who wins the popular vote to lose the election, as happened in 2000. This provides an incentive for candidates to reach out to voters in all parts of the country, not just the large states. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the electoral college system gives smaller states more influence than they would have if there was a direct popular vote.\n\nThe electoral college system also has its disadvantages. First, it is possible for a candidate who wins the popular vote to lose the election. This happened in 2000 and it happened again in 2016. Second, the electoral college system makes it possible for a candidate to win the presidency without receiving a majority of the popular vote. This happened in 2000 and it happened again in 2016. Third, the electoral college system reduces the power of individual voters. Each voter\u2019s vote is not equal to the vote of all the voters in the state. For example, a voter in California has more influence than a voter in Utah. Fourth, the electoral college system makes it difficult for third-party candidates to win an election. For example, Ross Perot received 19% of the vote in 1992, but he only received 1 electoral vote.\n\nThe Electoral College system should be replaced by a popular vote system. There are several reasons for this. First, it is not democratic to allow the candidate who wins the electoral college to win the election when he",
    "Summer school projects have been a common practice for years, but their nature has changed according to the needs of the community. They can be either student-designed or teacher-designed. I believe that student-designed projects are more effective in terms of learning outcomes and motivational factors.\n\nFirstly, the benefits of student-designed projects are that students are more motivated to complete them and they develop a sense of responsibility for the project\u2019s success. Since the student is the designer, he/she will have a better understanding of the project\u2019s purpose and requirements. For example, a student whose goal is to become a successful software engineer can create a project that involves designing an app for his/her school\u2019s library. This project will help the student to discover and improve his/her skills in programming, as well as to gain knowledge about the library\u2019s functions. Another example is of a student who wishes to become a successful animator. She can create a summer school project that involves creating a cartoon. This will help her to improve her drawing skills and learn about the principles of animation.\n\nSecondly, the benefits of teacher-designed projects are that they are more practical and they offer students the opportunity to develop organizational and structural skills. For instance, a student who wants to become a successful lawyer can design a summer school project in which she will create a case file. This project will help the student to learn how to organize information and to create a persuasive case. Another example is a student who wants to become a successful doctor. She can design a summer school project that involves creating a database of medical cases. This project will help the student to learn how to manage a database and how to create a logical structure.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the benefits of teacher-designed projects, I would argue that student-designed projects are more effective in terms of learning outcomes and motivational factors. The reasons for this are that students are more motivated to complete them, and they develop a sense of responsibility for the project\u2019s success.\n\n(583 words)\n\nThank you for your help!

    "Community service is one of the most effective ways to encourage people to take part in this activity. In my opinion, community service has several benefits, including improving the cleanliness and overall appearance of a community, and encouraging more people to participate in community service. I will support my opinion by explaining several important points.\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s well-known that people are more likely to engage in community service if they know that their work has a positive impact on the community. By participating in community service, people will have a chance to make a positive difference in their community. For example, they can plant trees in their community, which will make the community more beautiful and improve the environment. So, people may be more likely to participate in community service if they know they will contribute to making their community more beautiful.\n\nSecondly, community service can encourage people to take part in more activities. For instance, a person who participates in community service may be motivated to take part in other activities, such as cleaning the streets or the local park. So, community service can encourage people to take part in other activities.\n\nIn conclusion, community service has several benefits. It can improve the cleanliness and overall appearance of a community and encourage more people to participate in community service. I strongly believe that these benefits make community service a very important activity.\n\nI appreciate your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n[Name]\n\nP/S: I have posted this on the forum and also on the official IELTS website.

In this essay, I shall explain the benefits of seeking multiple opinions by giving examples from various fields such as medicine, sports, and gift-giving.\n\nIn the medical field, it is crucial to seek multiple opinions before making a diagnosis. For example, if a doctor has a patient who has a dark spot on the skin, he/she should consult a dermatologist. A dermatologist is a doctor who specializes in skin conditions. Therefore, the dermatologist will be able to give a more accurate diagnosis than a general practitioner. If the general practitioner diagnoses the patient with skin cancer, the patient may lose his/her life. However, if the patient seeks multiple opinions, he/she will be able to have the right diagnosis.\n\nIn the sports field, it is also crucial to seek multiple opinions. For example, if a coach wants to make a substitution in the middle of the game, he/she should consult with the other coaches. The coach should not make a substitution based on his/her own decision. This is because the coach may not be aware of the condition of the players on the bench. If he/she does not consult with the other coaches, he/she may make a wrong substitution. This may result in losing the game.\n\nIn the gift-giving field, it is also crucial to seek multiple opinions. For example, if a person wants to buy a gift for his/her friend, he/she should consult with the other people. The person should not buy a gift for his/her friend based on his/her own decision. This is because the person may not be aware of the interests of his/her friend. If he/she does not consult with the other people, he/she may buy a gift that his/her friend does not like. This may result in the friend not liking the gift.",
    "A variety of extracurricular activities is a significant part of our life, and it is also a crucial part of our school curriculum. However, some people believe that participation in extracurricular activities should be mandatory for all students. I disagree with this idea, and I will explain why in this essay.\n\nTo begin with, extracurricular activities are not only a waste of time, but also a waste of money. Students who are forced to participate in extracurricular activities will lose their interest in the activities, and they will end up giving up on the activities, and it is a waste of time and money. In addition to this, students who are forced to participate in extracurricular activities may be stressed and exhausted. As a result, they may not be able to focus on their studies.\n\nFurthermore, extracurricular activities are not needed for the students to be successful. If a student is good at a specific subject, he or she will be able to succeed even without participating in extracurricular activities. In addition to this, extracurricular activities are not needed to make friends. Students can make friends by studying together and talking to each other in class. Therefore, participation in extracurricular activities is not needed to make friends.\n\nIn conclusion, participation in extracurricular activities is not necessary for students. Students can succeed in their studies without participating in extracurricular activities. In addition to this, students can make friends without participating in extracurricular activities. Therefore, participation in extracurricular activities should not be mandatory.\n\nCite this essay\n\nShould Participation in Extracurricular Activities Be Mandatory for All Students?

    "I would like to start by saying that community service is a good punishment for juvenile offenders. This is because it helps them to learn about the society and their own community. Moreover, it helps the offenders to build self-esteem and improve their social relationships. However, some ethical considerations have to be taken into account. For instance, some offenders might think that they are being mistreated by the society and they will not be able to cope with the punishment. Additionally, some offenders might feel that they are being punished for a crime that they did not commit.\n\nIn my opinion, it is important to allow voluntary community service for minors. This is because it helps them to feel that they are contributing to the society. Furthermore, it helps them to build self-esteem. However, there are some potential drawbacks of allowing voluntary community service for minors. For example, some minors might feel that they are being punished for a crime that they did not commit.

    "I am in favor of this system, since it is a system that guarantees an accurate voting result. The Electoral College System is a system of indirect election of the President and the Vice President of the United States. In this system, the voters do not directly elect the President and the Vice President, but they elect members of the Electoral College who in turn elect the President and the Vice President.\n\nThe Electoral College is a group of persons who are chosen by the voters in every state and the District of Columbia to formally elect the President and the Vice President. The Electoral College consists of 538 members, one for each member of the United States Congress and three for the District of Columbia. Each state has a number of electors equal to the total of its membership in the Senate and House of Representatives (the number of electors is equal to the number of representatives plus two for the two senators from each state). The District of Columbia is allocated three electors, who are chosen by the state\u2019s voters. In addition to the 538 electors, the President and Vice President are chosen by the Electoral College.\n\nThe advantage of this system is that it allows for a more accurate voting result. There are 538 electors in the Electoral College, and every state has a number of electors equal to the total of its membership in the Senate and House of Representatives. The number of electors from each state depends on the population of the state.

    "Cell phones are a necessary tool for today's fast-paced world. They allow us to communicate with friends and family, take pictures, listen to music, navigate, and more.

    "The benefits of seeking multiple opinions when making decisions and solving problems can be clearly understood by the fact that it is a highly recommended practice even in the medical profession. I personally believe that this is because of the fact that decisions made in haste are usually not the right ones. I have seen this in personal situations as well as in my professional life. I have always found it a wise decision to seek multiple opinions before making a decision, and I have seen that this has helped me in solving problems in a better way.\n\nI faced a very difficult situation when I went for my first job interview after completing my post graduation. I was very excited to get my first job and was not ready to take any chances. I had recently come back from the US after doing my post graduation there, and was sure that I was a good candidate for the job. However, I did not get the job and immediately I started thinking that I had made a grave mistake by going for the interview. I was sure that I had made a mistake in the interview and that was the reason I didn\u2019t get the job. I was so stressed out that I could not think clearly and was not able to focus on anything. It was then that my friend suggested that I should seek the opinion of someone else before taking any further decision. I immediately contacted my friend and told him about my situation. He was very understanding and told me that I should not take any decision in haste. He explained to me the importance of seeking multiple opinions and suggested that I should seek the opinion of at least two more people. I did as he suggested and sought the opinion of two more friends. They were very understanding and told me that I should not take any hasty decision. They told me that I should not be so harsh on myself and that I should take some time to think about the entire situation. I was very thankful to them for their kind words. They also suggested that I should talk to my parents and discuss the entire situation with them. I did as they suggested and spoke to my parents about my job situation.

    "To begin with, the allowance of cell phones during lunch and free time in school would be beneficial in emergency situations. For example, if a student needs to go to the hospital for a family member, the student would be able to call his or her family right away. In addition, if a student has an upcoming assignment that he or she is unsure of, the student would be able to call his or her home to ask about the assignment. Another reason why cell phones should be allowed during free time is that there are many students who forget to bring their notes home and need to call their house to ask for their notes. Finally, the allowance of cell phones during free time would provide happiness to students. For example, if a student is having a bad day, the student would be able to call his or her family to tell them that he or she is having a bad day. In conclusion, the allowance of cell phones during free time and lunch for students would be beneficial in emergency situations, allowing students to call their home for notes, and providing happiness to students during their free time.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s ok?

    "In the past few decades, the use of cell phones has become a vital part of our lives. Since many people use their cell phones while driving, use of mobile devices while operating a vehicle is a matter of great concern. Since cell phone use while driving has become a very common practice, it has led to a substantial increase in the number of car accidents. This essay will discuss the dangers of using a cell phone while driving and the laws and regulations in the United States that aim to prevent this behavior. Additionally, this essay will analyze the impact of cell phone use on teen drivers and the overall number of car accidents caused by distracted driving. Finally, this essay will argue why drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\n\nFirstly, numerous studies have shown that cell phone use while driving can be extremely dangerous. According to a study by the National Safety Council, cell phone users are four times more likely to get into a car accident. Also, a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that 80% of car accidents are caused by distracted driving. Such statistics clearly show that cell phone use while driving can be extremely dangerous. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that drivers be educated about the dangers of using a cell phone while driving.\n\nSecondly, it is important to understand that due to their lack of experience, teen drivers are more likely to get into a car accident. This is because teen drivers are mostly distracted by their cell phones. In fact, a study by the National Safety Council found that 47% of teen drivers are distracted by their cell phones. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that drivers be educated about the dangers of using a cell phone while driving.\n\nFinally, it is important to understand that the use of cell phones while driving can lead to a substantial increase in the number of car accidents. According to a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,477 people were killed in 2015",
    "The Electoral College is the system used by the United States to elect the president and vice president. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, these electors are the persons who cast votes for president and vice president. They are chosen by voters in states, voters do not directly vote for the president, they vote for electors who then choose the president, 270 electors are needed to win the presidential election. The 23rd Amendment to the Constitution gives the District of Columbia three electors. Each state has a number of electors equal to their total number of representatives and senators in Congress. There are 435 representatives in the House of Representatives, 100 senators and three electors from the District of Columbia. The number of electors for each state is based on the total number of representatives and senators for the state. The method for awarding electors is determined by each state legislature, it can be a winner-take-all system or a proportional system. The winner-take-all system means that the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state gets all of that state's electors. The proportional system awards electors based on the percentage of the popular vote each candidate receives. The winner-take-all system is used in 48 states, the District of Columbia uses the proportional system. The Electoral College is a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The framers of the Constitution feared that electors would be pressured to vote for a particular candidate, they thought that electors would be independent and would choose the best candidate for president. The electoral college is a system that is not a direct democracy, it is a republican form of government. The electoral college system is based on the idea that the people elect electors to vote for the president, the electors are the ones who actually elect the president. The electors are chosen by the voters in the state, the electors in each state are officially called electors of President and Vice President of the United States. The electors have no official duties other than to vote for president and vice president. Their votes are recorded in the Journal of the Congress, the electors usually meet in their respective state capitols to cast their votes for president and vice president. The elector's votes are counted in a joint session of Congress, each state's delegation votes separately for president and vice president, the candidate who receives a majority of the electoral votes is elected president, if no candidate receives a majority then the House of Representatives elects the president.

    "Scientific exploration is the process of finding out new things about the world, and it is often carried out by a group of scientists working together, with the help of the latest technologies and machines. Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and it is the hottest planet in the solar system, having an average temperature of 462 degrees Celsius. The first humans to visit the Venus were the Russian Venera 7 and 8 probes in 1970, which successfully landed on the surface and returned images. However, the probes were only able to survive for 23 minutes and 59 minutes respectively, before succumbing to the extreme heat. With the help of the latest technologies, it is now possible to explore Venus with the help of hovering vehicles, which could reach the surface of the planet, and survive for a longer period of time.\n\nThere are several benefits and challenges of exploring Venus. The first benefit is that it is possible to find out whether Venus has ever had life, and whether there is any present life on the planet. The second benefit is that it is possible to find out whether Venus has any water in its atmosphere, which might be useful for future human exploration. The third benefit is that the hovering vehicles could be used to find out whether Venus could be colonized, and whether it is possible to extract water from the atmosphere. The challenges of exploring Venus are that it is likely to be extremely hot on the surface, and it would be difficult to find out whether there is any life on the planet, due to the extreme conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, exploring Venus is likely to be beneficial in terms of finding out whether there is any life on the planet, and whether it is possible to extract water from the atmosphere. However, the scientists should be aware that it is likely to be extremely hot on the surface, and it would be difficult to find out whether there is any life on the planet, due to the extreme conditions.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nJ\n\nAmanda\n\nRe: Need help with my essay\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Amanda \u00bb Fri Aug 24, 2018 6:51 pm\n\nHello J,\n\nThank you for your post.

    "Driverless cars are the cars that are not driven by humans. Instead, they are controlled by a computer system. In spite of having the same basic purpose as the other normal cars, driverless cars have a lot of advantages. In terms of the environment, these cars are very safe, and they are also very convenient for drivers. I will discuss all these advantages in more detail.\n\nFirst of all, the biggest advantage of driverless cars is their impact on the environment.

    "When a person is faced with a difficult decision, it is important to seek multiple opinions. Seeking multiple opinions can help eliminate non-beneficial advice and lead to making the right decision. It is also important to be open-minded and consider different perspectives when seeking advice.\n\nWhen a person is faced with a difficult decision, it is important to seek multiple opinions. An example of how seeking advice from more than one person can help eliminate non-beneficial advice would be when a person is faced with a decision about his/her career. The person should seek advice from a career counselor. A career counselor can help the person determine the best career for him/her based on the person\u2019s interests, skills, and personality. A career counselor can also help the person determine the best career for him/her based on the skills that are in demand in the job market. A career counselor is an expert in the field of careers and is therefore in a better position to give advice than a friend or family member.

    "The advent of driverless cars has been a boon to society in many ways. Unfortunately, they also have some drawbacks. The most important of these are safety, freedom, and the law.\n\nThe safety of driverless cars has been called into question. For example, a driverless car in the USA was involved in a crash that killed a woman, and a driverless car in the UK crashed, injuring the driver. Although these incidents were the fault of human drivers, not the driverless cars, they demonstrate that accidents can still occur. There are also concerns that driverless cars will not be able to handle all driving conditions. For example, a driverless car will not be able to drive safely in snowy or icy conditions because it will not be able to adjust its speed to account for slippery conditions. If driverless cars are involved in a lot of accidents, they will lose the trust of the public, which will make people less likely to use them.\n\nDriverless cars will also limit the freedom of the people who use them. For example, a person who uses a driverless car will not be able to drive as fast as they want. In addition, the driver will not be able to choose what route to take, as the car will decide this for them. This will limit the freedom of people who use driverless cars, and make them feel that they are being controlled by the machine.\n\nDriverless cars will also create legal issues. For example, a driverless car will not be able to stop at red lights, as the driver will not be paying attention. As a result, people will be able to argue that the driverless car was at fault for any accident that occurred. This will mean that drivers will not be liable for any accidents that occur in their cars.\n\nIn conclusion, while the advent of driverless cars has been a boon to society in many ways, they also have some drawbacks. The most important of these are safety, freedom, and the law.\n\nTotal words: 685\n\n#3\nJohn\nJan 28, 2019 @ 18:16:04\n\nHi Liz,\nI have a question about Task 2 essay.

    "------------------------------------------------\nThe election process for presidential, vice presidential, and senatorial positions in the United States is not fair. The current electoral system is not fair to smaller states. The electoral college, which is the system used in the United States, is not fair to smaller states because the number of votes a state receives is not proportionate to the number of citizens in the state. The electoral college gives 270 votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state. However, the number of votes a state receives is not an accurate representation of the number of citizens in the state. For example, California has approximately 37,000,000 citizens, but the state receives 55 electoral votes. This means that the state receives 1.9 electoral votes per 1,000 citizens. Other states receive less than 1.9 electoral votes per 1,000 citizens. This is not fair to smaller states because it means that the smaller states have less influence in the election process.\n\nAlso, the electoral college system gives more power to urban areas. The electoral college system is not fair to smaller states because it gives more power to urban areas. The electoral college system gives more weight to votes in urban areas than votes in rural areas. For example, the votes of",
    "Cars have become an essential part of our lives. However, they are also the main source of air pollution. The air pollution created by cars is responsible for the onset of respiratory problems and diseases. This has led to the development of car-free cities in order to reduce the amount of air pollution. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage and creating a car-free world, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, lower individual costs, improved safety, and the potential for a shift in American behavior. This essay will also use examples from sources such as Vauban, Germany and Colombia to support the arguments.\n\nThe first advantage of creating a car-free world is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is one of the major countries that emit greenhouse gases. It has been reported that the United States is responsible for 18% of global carbon dioxide emissions. The United States has the second highest carbon dioxide emissions in the world, after China. In addition, the United States is one of the countries that have experienced the greatest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the last 30 years. However, it is estimated that 25% of CO2 emissions are produced by cars. Therefore, it can be argued that reducing the number of cars will result in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe second advantage of creating a car-free world is the reduction of individual costs. It is estimated that the United States spends about $800 billion dollars each year in maintaining and operating cars. This means that the average American spends approximately $2,000 per year in operating and maintaining cars. In addition, the United States spends $200 billion each year on car insurance. Therefore, it can be argued that reducing the number of cars will result in a reduction of individual costs.\n\nThe third advantage of creating a car-free world is the improvement of safety. It is estimated that about 35,000 people die each year in car accidents in the United States. In addition, the average American spends about 1 hour per day in a car. Therefore, it can be argued that reducing the number of cars will result in an improvement of safety.\n\nThe fourth advantage of creating a car-free world is the potential for a shift in American behavior. It is estimated that each American spends approximately 45 minutes per day in their car. In addition, it is estimated that 50% of Americans live in suburbs. Therefore, it can be argued that reducing the number of cars will result in a shift in American behavior.\n\nThe Vauban, Germany is an example of a car-free city. The Vauban, Germany is located in the city of Freiburg. The Vauban, Germany is a car-free city. The Vauban, Germany was developed in the 1980s. The Vaub",
    "The electoral college is an important part of the US government system, which was established in 1789. It is a process that is used to select the president and vice president of the US. It is a process that is used to elect a president of the United States of America. The electoral college is a group of electors from each state, who are appointed by the people of that state. Each elector cast one vote for president and one vote for vice president. The candidate who gets the most votes wins the election.\n\nThere are some advantages of the electoral college. First of all, it is a fair system. It is not based on the population of the state, but it is based on the number of senators and representatives of that state. In other words, the system is based on the geographical area. Therefore, the votes of people in the big states are not more important than the votes of people in small states. Also, the electoral college is a simple system. It is simple to understand. A person does not need to know much about politics to understand the system. For example, the person only needs to know the number of senators and representatives of his or her states.\n\nThere are also some disadvantages of the electoral college. First of all, the system is unfair. It is unfair because the votes of people in the big states are more important than the votes of people in small states. For example, if a person lives in a small state, his or her vote is not important. Also, the system is complicated. A person needs to know much about politics to understand the system. For example, a person needs to know the number of senators and representatives of his or her state.\n\nIn conclusion, the electoral college is an important part of the US government system, which was established in 1789. There are some advantages and disadvantages of the system. I believe that the electoral college should be abolished.\n\nessay writing\n\n- 4.00 / 5 5 \n- 1 / 5\n- 2 / 5\n- 3 / 5\n- 4 / 5\n- 5 / 5\n\n1 vote, 4.00 avg. rating (84% score)\n\nOne thought on \u201c Essay with 377 words on the electoral college\u201d\n\nPingback: Writing an Essay on the Electoral College - International Student Blog",
    "The basic purpose of seeking advice is to help us to make best decisions in our life. It is important to seek advice before taking any important action. However, it is also necessary to evaluate the advice we receive and make our own decisions before taking action. If we blindly follow the advice of others, it can have negative consequences in our life.\n\nTo begin with, seeking advice is a great way to make better decisions in life. If we do not seek advice on a particular matter, we may make wrong decisions. For example, if we are considering buying a car from a car dealer, we can seek advice from our friends about the car dealer. We can also check reviews of the car dealer on the internet. By seeking advice, we can get a better idea about the car dealer and make a better decision.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also necessary to evaluate the advice we receive. We should not blindly follow the advice of others. For instance, if we are considering buying a car from a car dealer, we can seek advice from our friends about the car dealer. But we should also check reviews of the car dealer on the internet. If our friends recommend the car dealer but the reviews of the car dealer are negative, we should not blindly follow the advice of our friends.\n\nIn conclusion, it is beneficial to seek advice before taking any important action.

    "Community service is an activity that is very important to students. It is true that community service can impact students\u2019 academic success. There are many examples of how community service can impact students\u2019 success, and I will explain some of them in this essay.\n\nFirst of all, community service can help students develop important skills for their future jobs, such as communication skills, teamwork skills, and leadership skills. These skills will help them to achieve success in their future jobs. A recent study has shown that students who had community service experience are more likely to be employed than students who did not have such experience.

When he graduated, he got a job in a big company, and he is now very successful.\n\nSecond, community service can help students become more confident and self-assured.

    "We have all heard the stories of the students who have sacrificed their grades in order to play sports. Unfortunately, this is a common occurrence in schools around the country. I believe that no student should be allowed to participate in sports if they have failed to maintain a C average. In order to play sports in high school, students must remain at a C average in order to be eligible. However, many students are not held accountable to this standard and continue to play sports. I believe that if students are not going to try in school, they should not be allowed to play sports. This is a privilege, not a right, and should be treated as such. If a student is not willing to work hard enough to get a C average, they should not be allowed to play sports.\n\nI understand that many students will argue that sports are a big part of their lives and they enjoy playing them. However, the school day is long, and students should be able to focus on their studies and not on sports. Many students are involved in multiple sports and activities and it is difficult for them to focus on their studies.

    "Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a set of universal human facial expressions which have been identified and classified. Facial expressions are of crucial importance in human communication because it is a vital part of non-verbal communication. Facial expressions and body language are more accurate than verbal communication because it cannot be lied unlike verbal communication. Because of the importance of facial expressions in human communication, it is the most important element of social interaction, and it is used to express a variety of emotions.\n\nAccording to Paul Ekman, the creator of FACS, every human emotion has a specific facial expression, and every facial expression is universal and unique. Ekman argued that facial expressions are the only universal communication. However, Ekman\u2019s research was criticized because it suggested that facial expressions can be used as a diagnostic tool. However, it is important to note that facial expressions are not the only way to communicate emotions. There are some limitations to FACS. FACS does not account for the differences in facial expressions between men and women. It is also important to note that the facial expressions are influenced by culture, gender, and age. Also, it is important to note that facial expressions are not the only way to communicate emotions.\n\nFACS is also very important for social interaction.

    "The danger of using cell phones while driving is one of the major causes of distracted driving accidents. This is because phone calls and text messaging require the driver to take his or her eyes off the road, hands off the wheel, and mind off the task of driving. As a result, cell phone use increases the risk of crashing.\n\nFirstly, there are many instances where drivers are involved in accidents while using cell phones. In a study conducted by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, researchers found that drivers using a cell phone were 4 times more likely to get involved in a crash. This is because cell phone users are more likely to be distracted and are less likely to react quickly in emergencies.\n\nSecondly, drivers who use cell phones while driving are more likely to experience fatigue. This is because driving is a cognitively demanding task that requires full attention. Using a cell phone while driving causes fatigue because one must concentrate on the road and concentrate on the conversation. This results in poor driving performance and increased risk of crashing.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of cell phones while driving contributes to distracted driving accidents because it causes drivers to take their eyes, hands, and minds off the task of driving. This increases the risk of crashing. Therefore, it is important that drivers do not use cell phones while driving.\n\n(I know this is a very long essay, but I would be very grateful if you could correct it.)\n\n1 Comment\n\nChristine\nAugust 23, 2013\n\nHello, I would be very grateful if you could help me with my essay.

    "In the last two decades, the number of cars on the road has increased exponentially. While cars offer a great deal of conveniences and are a symbol of freedom, they also cause a lot of problems. In this essay, I will discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of limiting car usage, including its impact on the economy, the environment, and individual transportation needs. I will also discuss the role of factors such as gas stations and car dealerships in affecting the effects of limiting car usage. Finally, I will discuss the potential for advancements in car safety features to mitigate the negative effects of car usage.\n\nCar usage has a negative impact on the economy in several ways. When gas is purchased, the government loses tax revenue. This is because the government taxes gas. In addition, when cars are purchased, the government loses tax revenue in the form of sales tax. Also, when car repairs are made, the government loses tax revenue in the form of sales tax. Furthermore, when cars are purchased, the government loses tax revenue in the form of excise tax.

According to a survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), 4.5 million children are homeschooled in the United States. This number has increased by around 3% every year since 1999. This means that more and more parents are choosing to homeschool their children. One of the reasons for this is that homeschooling allows children to focus on their education without the distractions of a school environment. For example, students who struggle with traditional schooling environments have increased focus and responsibility because they are not distracted by their peers or the noise of the classroom.\n\nAnother benefit of homeschooling is that it offers a more personalized learning experience. Homeschooling allows children to learn at their own pace, which means that each student can work at their own level and not be forced to keep up with their peers. Homeschooling also allows students to learn subjects that they are interested in, which may not be offered in public schools. For example, if a student is interested in literature, they may choose to focus on writing essays instead of taking a course on poetry.\n\nHomeschooling can be a viable option for those who struggle with traditional schooling environments. It offers students an increased focus and responsibility, as well as a more personalized learning experience. Homeschooling does not replace traditional schooling, but it does provide an alternative for those who struggle in traditional environments.

    "The \"Face\" on Mars is not an alien or human, but rather a natural landform, using evidence from scientific research and analysis of the harsh Martian climate. The \"Face\" on Mars is a natural landform, as it is comprised of a combination of wind, water, and volcanic activity. These Martian landforms are shaped by the same forces that shape the landforms on Earth. The \"Face\" on Mars appears to be made of basalt, which is the same material that forms basalt columns on Earth. This basalt column formation is due to the cooling of basaltic lava, which causes the lava to crack into columns. The \"Face\" on Mars is made of this basaltic lava, which is the same material that forms the basalt columns on Earth. The \"Face\" on Mars is also made of wind and water erosion, as it has been shaped by these forces. The erosion of the \"Face\" on Mars is similar to erosion on Earth, where wind and water shape the landscape.

    "Attending school is an important part of the education system, and online schooling is an option that continues to grow. Online schooling offers many benefits for students who struggle to attend class on a daily basis. For instance, online schooling allows students to go at their own pace, have no distractions, and work in a more comfortable environment. However, many people believe that students do not benefit from attending online classes at home rather than attending public schools.\n\nFirst of all, online schooling allows students to go at their own pace. For example, students can look at their classwork at any time and work on the assignments that they find the most difficult. Also, students can take longer to complete assignments when they are having trouble understanding the material. In contrast, students who attend public school are required to work with their classmates and teachers at the same pace, even if they find that the teacher is moving too fast or too slow.\n\nSecond of all, online schooling allows students to have no distractions. For example, students can work without being distracted by classmates or teachers. Also, students can work in a better and more comfortable environment. In contrast, students who attend public school have many distractions, such as students talking, walking around, or making noise. Also, students are often uncomfortable when they attend public school, especially on hot days when they have to sit in a classroom with no air conditioning.\n\nThird and lastly, online schooling allows students to work in a more comfortable environment. For example, students can work in a room with air conditioning or in a room with a desk and a chair. Also, students can work with no distractions. In contrast, students who attend public school have to sit in a classroom with no air conditioning and other distractions.\n\nTo sum up, online schooling offers many benefits for students who struggle to attend class on a daily basis. First of all, online schooling allows students to go at their own pace. Second of all, online schooling allows students to have no distractions. Finally, online schooling allows students to work in a more comfortable environment.

    "Some people may argue that in today\u2019s society, community service is not something that should be required of high school students. They may think that it is a waste of time and that students should be focusing on their education. However, I believe that community service should be required of high school students because it teaches them the importance of helping others and it helps them to become more compassionate and caring people.\n\nFirst of all, it is important to know that community service teaches students the importance of helping others. Many people would agree that it is important for people to help others whenever they can, but it is not always easy to do so. By requiring students to complete community service, it will teach them the importance of helping others and will also help them to develop the skills that are needed to do so. Furthermore, community service can be a great way for students to become more compassionate and caring. It can help them understand what it is like to be in need and to have someone help them out with their problems. Finally, community service can be a great way for students to meet new people and make new friends. By doing so, they can make connections that may last them for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that community service is an important part of society and it should be required of all high school students. It can help them to become more compassionate and caring people, and it can also teach them the importance of helping others whenever they can.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn Doe\n\n2.

    "On the 1st of January 2017, a new law was passed in my state of North Carolina. The law states that all drivers in the state must use hands-free devices for all cell phone usage while driving. The law prohibits drivers from using cell phones while driving and from holding cell phones while driving.\n\nThe law was passed to prevent drivers from texting while driving. Texting while driving is a very dangerous activity that causes many accidents every year. Texting while driving is a form of distracted driving. Distracted driving is a major cause of accidents every year. In 2018, distracted driving caused 391,000 accidents according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). These distracted driving accidents caused 3,166 deaths and 450,000 injuries. If the new law had been in place in 2018, it is likely that distracted driving accidents would have been reduced by over 300,000.\n\nThe law is not only important for the safety of drivers, but also for the safety of pedestrians and others who may be on the road. Cell phone usage while driving is a very dangerous activity that can cause many accidents and injuries. The law is also important because it prevents drivers from using cell phones while driving. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are more likely to cause accidents.\n\nThe new law is important because it prevents drivers from using cell phones while driving.

    "Although there are two different views on whether students should bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, I agree with the fact that students should be allowed to use their phones as long as they are turned off during class time.\n\nFirstly, students should not be allowed to bring their phones to school because it distracts them from their studies. Secondly, students should be allowed to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times because they can use them to communicate with their parents in case of emergency. Thirdly, students should be allowed to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times because they can use them to communicate with their friends. Last but not least, students should be allowed to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times because they can use them to look up information for their homework.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as they are turned off during class time.\n\nHelpful 1 \nAnswered by Lina, An Expert in the Writing - General Category\n\nWhere to study abroad for a degree in filmmaking?\n\nI am a film student and would like to know where I can study abroad for a degree in filmmaking.

    "The use of cell phones during class time has become a common practice among students. However, this usage has certain negative effects. In this essay, I will explain the negative effects of allowing students to use cell phones during class time and argue for limiting their use to only during lunch periods or free time.\n\nFirstly, cell phones can cause distraction. For example, a student who is using a cell phone during a lecture would most likely not listen to the teacher and would be distracted by the phone. This distraction would then lead to the student getting lower grades and would ultimately affect the student\u2019s education. This is the reason why it is important to limit the usage of cell phones during class time.\n\nSecondly, cell phones can be dangerous. For example, a student who is using a cell phone during a lecture would most likely not pay attention to the surrounding area. This would then lead to the student not noticing if someone is approaching him or her and could result in the student being robbed or attacked. This is the reason why it is important to limit the usage of cell phones during class time.\n\nFinally, cell phones can cause disruption in class. For example, a student who is using a cell phone during a lecture would most likely be talking to others using the phone. This would then lead to the student talking to others instead of listening to the teacher and this would ultimately affect the student\u2019s education. This is the reason why it is important to limit the usage of cell phones during class time.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several negative effects of allowing students to use cell phones during class time. Therefore, it is important to limit the usage of cell phones during class time.\n\nArgumentative Essay\n\nThe topic of this essay is: The use of cell phones during class time has become a common practice among students.

In this essay, I will explain the advantages of living in a car-free society and will also discuss the advantages of this kind of society.\n\nFirst of all, cars have a huge influence on the environment.

    "Driverless cars are cars that have the ability to drive themselves without the need for any human interaction. These cars have the potential to reduce the number of accidents and traffic, however, they also have the risks associated with malfunctioning and unintended destinations. Moreover, they also have an impact on marketing and consumer behavior and the overall feasibility and safety of this technology.\n\nFirst of all, cars that are self-driving have the potential to reduce the number of accidents and traffic. This is because cars that are self-driving have the ability to read road signs and detect other vehicles on the road. For example, cars that are self-driving have the ability to detect an obstacle in the road and immediately stop to avoid hitting it. As a result, cars that are self-driving have the potential to reduce accidents and decrease traffic.\n\nOn the other hand, cars that are self-driving have the risks associated with malfunctioning and unintended destinations. This is because cars that are self-driving have the ability to read road signs, however, they also have the ability to malfunction and read the wrong signs.

    "The Electoral College is hindering the robust political system of the American government and should be abolished in favor of a popular vote. The Electoral College is a system that was used to elect the president and vice president of the United States. It is a system where the people vote for the electors that represent their state and the electors vote for president and vice president. The reason why the Electoral College was created was because the founding fathers believed that the people were not educated enough to vote for the president. What the founding fathers did not realize was that the people are educated enough to vote for the president, so the Electoral College is just a system that is used to prevent the people from voting for the president. The Electoral College should be abolished in favor of a popular vote because the Electoral College is an outdated system that is not used in other countries because it is undemocratic, it is not fair for the people, and it causes polarization in the government.\n\nThe Electoral College is an outdated system that is not used in other countries because it is undemocratic.

    "Community service is an act of volunteering one's time and energy for the betterment of the society. It is a noble act and should be encouraged in all universities, however, it should not be made compulsory for all students. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of encouraging community service and discuss alternative ways to encourage participants.\n\nFirst of all, community service has major benefits for the society. For example, if a person is a teacher, he or she can volunteer in a library for a few hours. This will be advantageous for the society as well as the teacher. For example, the teacher can get to know the children better and can also get an idea about the difficulties the children face and how to solve them. As a result, the teacher can help the children in a better way.\n\nHowever, making community service compulsory for students can be problematic. For example, if a student does not want to be a teacher, he or she may not get any benefit from such programs. In this case, such students will not be motivated to",
    "Driverless cars are the latest innovation in the automobile industry. This technology is still quite new, and the main concern is whether it will improve or deteriorate the current state of transportation in society. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of driverless cars, and their impact on safety, energy consumption and innovation.\n\nDriverless cars are expected to improve safety by reducing the number of accidents caused by human error. In a study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 94% of crashes were caused by human error. This means that driverless cars will almost certainly reduce the number of accidents. In addition, they will reduce the number of fatalities caused by road accidents. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1.35 million road deaths occur every year, and 90% of these are caused by human error. This statistic is expected to be significantly reduced when driverless cars are introduced to the market.\n\nDriverless cars will also reduce the amount of energy consumed by the automobile industry. According to a study conducted by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), transportation accounts for 27% of the United States\u2019 total energy consumption. This means that driverless cars will reduce the amount of energy used by the transportation industry, and in turn, reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. This will have a positive impact on the environment, and will reduce the chances of global warming.\n\nDriverless cars will also reduce the levels of innovation in the automobile industry. Driverless cars are designed to perform tasks that are currently performed by drivers. This means that the process of designing, manufacturing and selling cars will be significantly reduced. In addition, the number of jobs within the industry will also be significantly reduced. This will lead to a reduction in the levels of innovation within the automobile industry, which will in turn, reduce the levels of innovation in society.\n\nIn conclusion, driverless cars will have a positive impact on safety, energy consumption and innovation. However, it is important to note that this technology is still quite new, and further research is required to determine its long-term impact on society.\n\n(371 words)\n\nAfter I submitted the essay, I received an automated response from the IELTS team, which is as follows:\n\nDear Applicant,\n\nThank you for contacting the IELTS team.\n\nThe IELTS team can only provide feedback on essays that have been purchased as part of the IELTS Writing Correction",
    "Driverless cars are already being used for a variety of purposes, from commuting to work, to shopping, and even to transportation. While the idea of driverless cars is interesting, it is important to consider the potential dangers and limitations of driverless cars as well as the role of government in regulating this technology.\n\nThe first potential danger of driverless cars is the inability of the car to sense pedestrians, animals, and buildings in its surroundings. For example, a driverless car, unable to see a child running into the road, may not be able to avoid hitting the child. Additionally, driverless cars may not be able to detect buildings or other objects in the road, and may therefore crash into them. This may cause damage to the vehicle, and may even result in injuries to the driver or passengers. Finally, driverless cars may not be able to detect animals on the road, which may lead to the death of the animal as well as the death of the driver and passengers.\n\nThe second potential danger of driverless cars is the possibility of system malfunctions. For example, a driverless car may suddenly stop in the middle of the road, causing an accident. Additionally, driverless cars may malfunction due to software errors, which may lead to the car crashing into other vehicles or objects, or even causing a fire.\n\nThe final potential danger of driverless cars is the lack of accountability for accidents and damages. For example, if a driverless car crashes",
    "As a child, I was taught to be decisive and to make decisions without consulting others. However, I have learnt that the best decision is not necessarily the one that is made by oneself but the one that is made in conjunction with others. In fact, I have come to realise that seeking multiple opinions offers several advantages.\n\nTo begin with, seeking multiple opinions allows one to obtain a more comprehensive perspective. For example, when I was deciding on a course to study in university, I did not have a clear idea of my future career path. As a result, I sought advice from my parents, who are both teachers, and my teachers at school, who are all professionals in different fields. After listening to their suggestions, I was able to make a better-informed decision.\n\nSecondly, seeking multiple opinions can help to minimize the risks of making a wrong decision. For example, when I was deciding on a course to study in university, I did not have a clear idea of my future career path.

    "The use of cell phones and other electronic devices has become a major part of our lives nowadays, but it is also causing immense problems, which are discussed below.\n\nThe first problem is that there is an increasing number of accidents caused due to texting and driving because it distracts the driver. For example, according to the article \u201cTexting and Driving Kills\u201d (2013), 11 teenagers die every day in the USA due to texting and driving. Therefore, it is necessary to have laws and regulations to reduce the number of accidents.\n\nFurthermore, it is also harming our personal relationships because we are using our phones more than we are communicating with each other. For example, when we are together with friends, we are often using our phones to check social media and messages.

However, these devices also cause many problems, which are discussed below.\n\nThe first problem is that there is an increasing number of accidents caused by texting and driving, as it distracts the driver. For example, according to the article \u201cTexting and Driving Kills\u201d (2013), 11 teenagers die every day in the USA due to texting and driving.

    "It was late 1945. I was a young boy, 17 years old, and in the midst of World War II. My father had been killed at the front in France. My mother had died of starvation. I was alone in the world. I had no idea what to do. I was a seagoing cowboy, and my job was to take care of the cattle during the voyage to Europe. I got used to it pretty quickly. My duties included feeding, watering, and cleaning the animals. I was also responsible for making sure the animals were transported safely to Europe, and that they were delivered to the proper location in Europe. The cattle boats were originally built to transport cargo, so they were very big. They were also very well equipped. The boats had huge doors, and the doors were open all the time. The doors were so large that the boats could carry more cows than they could hold. The boats were also equipped with huge engines, so they were very fast. The boats were very fast, so they were very dangerous. The boats were also very large, so they were very dangerous. The boats were also very dangerous, so they were very dangerous. The boats were very dangerous, so they were very dangerous. The boats were also very dangerous, so they were very dangerous. The boats were",
    "Venus is an interesting planet. Its surface is much hotter than the surfaces of any other planets in the solar system, and its atmosphere is composed of carbon dioxide, which has the potential to make it a greenhouse planet. Moreover, Venus is also our planetary neighbor, which means it is much easier to explore this planet than other planets in our solar system. In spite of these similarities, Venus is also very different from Earth in several ways. In this essay, I will discuss the feasibility of human habitation on Venus, taking into consideration the similarities and differences between the two planets, as well as the extreme conditions present on Venus.\n\nFirst of all, the most obvious difference between Venus and Earth is that Venus is much hotter than Earth. In fact, the surface temperature of Venus is 462\u00b0C, while the surface temperature of Earth is 15\u00b0C. However, this does not mean that Venus is uninhabitable, since human beings are able to withstand a much higher temperature than 462\u00b0C. For example, a human body can withstand a temperature of 40-41\u00b0C without any harm. Therefore, if human beings were to live on Venus, they would need to develop technology to withstand the high temperature on Venus, such as a special suit that keeps the body at a constant temperature.\n\nAnother difference between Venus and Earth is that Venus has no magnetic field to protect it from harmful radiation and meteorites. In fact, it is estimated that 99.9% of the meteorites that hit Venus are from Earth. Therefore, human beings would need to find a way to protect themselves from harmful radiation and meteorites in order to live on Venus.\n\nDespite these differences, Venus is much more similar to Earth than Mars, since it is much closer to Earth than Mars. This means that it is much easier to explore Venus than Mars. Moreover, it is",
    "The United States is a democratic country. The United States is one of the few countries where the president is elected by the Electoral College. This system was created by the framers of the Constitution. The Electoral College is a group of people who are elected by the people to elect the president. The Electoral College is composed of 538 electors, one for each member of the House of Representatives and two for each member of the Senate. The electors are distributed based on the total number of members of the House and the Senate. The number of electors for each state is determined by the total number of members of the House and the Senate. The number of electors is determined by the number of representatives in the House of Representatives plus two for each member of the Senate. The state law determines how electors are selected. The winner takes all system is used in the United States to elect the president. When a candidate wins a state he or she also wins all of the electors in that state. The preparation of the Certificate of Ascertainment is required by the Electoral College to be completed by December 18th. The Certificate of Ascertainment is a document that is signed by the Governor of the state and is sent to the President of the Senate, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the Archivist of the United States.

    "In our modern society, parents have a variety of educational options for their children. With the rapid development of technology, online classes and home schooling are becoming more popular than ever. While some people think that traditional schools are better for students, I disagree and believe that home schooling or online classes are more beneficial.\n\nFirstly, one of the main advantages of home schooling or online classes is that they can be more convenient and flexible for students. For instance, online classes can be accessed from any place at any time, so students can study whenever and wherever they want. Additionally, home schooling can be more suitable for students who have special needs. For example, a student who is very shy or has a learning disability may benefit from home schooling because they can take their time, receive personalized attention, and learn at their own pace. In contrast, traditional schools are not as flexible because they require students to attend classes at specific times and places.\n\nSecondly, home schooling or online classes can help students develop better social skills. For example, a student who is home schooled or takes online classes may have more opportunities to interact with their peers, teachers, and mentors. Furthermore, students may learn to be more independent and self-sufficient because they are not as dependent on their parents or teachers for guidance and support.\n\nFinally, home schooling or online classes can also be beneficial for certain students. For example, students who have special needs or are gifted may thrive in an environment where they can learn at their own pace. Furthermore, students who live in remote areas may not have access to traditional public or private schools. For instance, a student who lives in a rural area may not be able to attend classes at a nearby school. However, they may be able to take classes through an online school or be home schooled.\n\nIn conclusion, although traditional schools may be more suitable for some students, I believe that home schooling or online classes are better alternatives for other students. For example, home schooling or online classes can be more convenient and flexible, can help students develop better social skills, and can be beneficial for certain students.\n\nThanks,\nAdrian\n\n\u200b\n\nLike this:\n\nLike \n\nRelated\n\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized.

    "The existence of the face on Mars has been a controversial topic since its discovery in 1976. The face was detected by the Viking 1 orbiter. Immediately, speculation of alien creation was high. The face is located on the Cydonia region, an area of Mars that has been extensively studied. The face is approximately 1.5 kilometers in diameter and is located on a plateau. The plateau is surrounded by areas that appear to have been shaped by water. The face is a low, single-story building. Many people believe that the face is a pyramid with a temple on top. They also believe that there are other pyramids on the plateau, with one of them being the source of the face. In 1999, the Mars Global Surveyor obtained a better image of the face.

    "Driverless cars, also called autonomous cars or self-driving cars, are vehicles that have the ability to navigate without human intervention. These cars are equipped with a variety of sensors that allow them to detect the environment, such as the location and condition of other vehicles and pedestrians. The sensors are connected to a computer that analyzes the information gathered and drives the car in a safe manner. The sensors are designed to detect objects that are within a certain distance of the car, such as pedestrians and other vehicles. In order to ensure that the car is operating safely, it is necessary for the computer to make decisions based on the information gathered from the sensors. There are many potential benefits associated with driverless cars, including their ability to prevent accidents, assist disabled individuals, and reduce the need for human intervention while driving. One of the most obvious benefits of driverless cars is that they can prevent accidents. In order to prevent accidents, driverless cars must be able to detect and avoid objects in the road. For example, if a car is driving in the left lane of a two-lane highway and a truck enters the left lane from the right, the car must be able to detect the truck and move over to the right lane in order to avoid a collision. Another benefit of driverless cars is that they can assist disabled individuals. For example, a person who is blind or visually impaired might be able to use a driverless car to get to work or school without assistance from another person. A driverless car could also be used by someone who has trouble walking or is in a wheelchair. Finally, driverless cars can reduce the need for human intervention while driving. For example, a person who is driving a car and suddenly becomes sick or injured might need to stop driving in order to seek medical attention. In this scenario, a driverless car could be programmed to continue driving until it reaches a safe location or until help arrives. However, there are also some potential drawbacks or limitations associated with driverless cars. For example, it is not currently possible for a driverless car to drive on unpaved roads or in inclement weather conditions such as snow or rain. Additionally, driverless cars require a lot of computing power and are very expensive to manufacture. It is also possible that driverless cars could be hacked into by hackers who want to cause harm to other vehicles on the road. Overall, I believe that driverless cars have the potential to prevent accidents, assist disabled individuals, and reduce the",
    "The question above is a very debatable one. It is true that students who are doing well academically should be provided with the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities. However, I believe that students who are struggling academically should be allowed to participate in extracurricular activities as well. This is because participation in extracurricular activities can benefit students in many ways.\n\nFirstly, extracurricular activities can boost students' confidence and self-esteem. This is because participating in extracurricular activities can help students to feel that they are being productive and are contributing to the school community in a positive way. Furthermore, extracurricular activities can provide students with a sense of purpose and motivation. Students will feel a sense of achievement when they show skills and abilities that are not necessarily related to academic success, such as leadership skills. Through participation in extracurricular activities, students can also develop their leadership skills, which can be useful in their future careers.\n\nSecondly, extracurricular activities can help students to develop their social skills. This is because participating in extracurricular activities can enable students to interact with their peers in an informal setting. Furthermore, extracurricular activities can also help students to develop their communication skills, which can be useful in their future careers.\n\nIn conclusion",
    "The enactment of the \"hands free\" law has been a hotly debated issue in recent years. While some opponents of the law claim that it is ineffective in reducing the risk of car accidents, I believe that the law is largely effective in reducing the risk of car accidents. In this essay, I will discuss the impact of the \"hands free\" law on drivers who rely on their cell phones for navigation and emergency communication, and argue whether or not the law is effective in reducing the risk of car accidents.\nFirstly, the \"hands free\" law has a positive impact on drivers who rely on their cell phones for navigation and emergency communication. As the law is enacted, drivers can use their cell phones to communicate with others without any hand-held device, which will lead to a safer driving condition. For instance, if a driver has a flat tire, she can make a call to the roadside assistance service and wait for the service provider to come to the scene. If she uses a hand-held device to call the service provider, she will have to hold the phone in one hand and operate the car with the other hand, which will increase the risk of car accidents. In addition, drivers who rely on their cell phones for navigation are required to use their hands to hold the phone and follow the navigation instructions. If the phone is put on the car dashboard, drivers can look at the phone and follow the navigation instructions without any hand-held device. Therefore, the enactment of the \"hands free\" law has a positive impact on drivers who rely on their cell phones for navigation and emergency communication.\nSecondly, the \"hands free\" law is largely effective in reducing the risk of car accidents.

    "The potential risks and downfalls of self-driving cars, including the possibility of creating a new breed of lazy individuals, the loss of enjoyment in driving, and the potential dangers of malfunctions and accidents, outweigh the benefits of self-driving cars.\n\nThe first potential risk of self-driving cars is the possibility of creating a new breed of lazy individuals. Many people in modern society have already become lazy, and the invention of self-driving cars will only worsen the problem. If people are able to sit in their cars and have their cars drive them to and from work, they will have no reason to get out of their cars and walk. As a result, they will become even more lazy and won\u2019t get any exercise. This will lead to heart disease, obesity, and other problems. Also, self-driving cars will allow people to sleep in and still get to work on time, which will take away from their sleep time. People will be tired when they get to work, and this will have a negative impact on their productivity. As a result, self-driving cars will have a negative impact on the economy because people won\u2019t be as productive at work.\n\nThe second potential risk of self-driving cars is the loss of enjoyment in driving. Since self-driving cars will do all the work, people will just sit in their cars and not enjoy the ride. This will take away from the enjoyment of driving, which is one of the things that people enjoy about driving. Also, self-driving cars will take away the thrill of driving because people will just sit in their cars and not pay attention to what is happening outside of their cars. As a result, people will lose the enjoyment of driving, which will cause them to not enjoy driving as much as they used to.\n\nThe third potential risk of self-driving cars is the potential dangers of malfunctions and accidents. If the self-driving cars have a malfunction, they could crash into other cars or a wall, which would cause injury or death. As a result, self-driving cars will have a negative impact on society because people will be scared to drive self-driving cars because they will be afraid that they will crash into other cars.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential risks and downfalls of self-driving cars, including the possibility of creating a new breed of lazy individuals, the loss of enjoyment in driving, and the potential dangers of malfunctions and accidents, outweigh the benefits of self-driving cars.\n\nGrammar and spelling errors:\n\nLine 5, column 202, Rule ID: UPPERCASE_SENTENCE_START\n\nSuggestion: As\n\n...riving cars will only worsen the problem.

    "Driverless cars have been a hot topic for a while now. While companies like Tesla and Uber are already working on the technology for self-driving cars, others have been sceptical about the idea. The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" by James Fallows presents both sides of the argument of the introduction of the technology, discussing the positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. While the article does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether driverless cars will be a success, it does argue in favour of the technology and gives an outlook of the possible future of driverless cars.\n\nThe article begins by discussing the positive aspects of driverless cars. Firstly, the article argues that driverless cars are likely to be safer than cars with a driver. In fact, Fallows states that \"one of the most compelling arguments for self-driving cars is that they will make driving safer\" (Fallows 2016). This is supported by statistics and facts presented later in the article. According to Fallows, \"the number of people killed by cars in the United States has dropped by more than a third since 2007, and by more than half since 1990. Perhaps the biggest single reason is the widespread introduction of anti-lock brakes\" (Fallows 2016). Furthermore, the article indicates that driverless cars will be safer because they are likely to be less likely to have accidents. This is because, according to the article, driverless cars will be less likely to be distracted by other cars or objects on the road and will be less likely to speed. Fallows argues that \"if self-driving cars have a lot less to pay attention to, then they are likely to be a lot less distracted. And if they are less distracted, they will be less likely to speed\" (Fallows 2016). Additionally, the article argues that driverless cars will be safer because they will be able to avoid accidents that are caused by other cars. This is because \"if your car is self-driving, you will be able to drive in a pack more safely, with more space between you and the car ahead, because the car ahead will do so not at the whim of a distracted human but in response to a computer's reaction time\" (Fallows 2016). Finally, the article argues that driverless cars will be safer because they will be able to avoid accidents when they are in an accident. This is because \"if your car is self-driving, it will be able to avoid an accident in the first place because the computer will always be looking ahead, and will be able to make a move before the car ahead does\" (Fallows 2016). The article also argues that driverless cars will be safer because they will be able to avoid accidents when they are in an accident. This is because \"if your car is self-driving, it will be able to avoid an accident in the first place because the computer will always be looking ahead, and will be able to make a move before the car ahead does\" (Fallows 2016). The article also argues that driverless cars will be safer because they will be able to avoid accidents when they are in an accident. This is because \"if your car is self-driving, it will be able to avoid an accident in the first place because the computer will always be looking ahead, and will be able to make a move before the car ahead does\" (Fallows 2016). The article also argues that driverless cars will be safer because they will be able to avoid accidents when they are in an accident.\n\nThe article then discusses the negative aspects of driverless cars. First, the article argues that driverless cars will be more likely to be stolen. This is because \"the computer can be more easily stolen than the car itself\" (Fallows 2016). Additionally, the article argues that driverless cars will be",
    "It is said that \"Two heads are better than one\". In this era of competition, people are always in search of newer and better things. They want to upgrade their lifestyle, their possessions, their knowledge. Every one of us is in a constant state of decision making. When it comes to decision making, people often seek the opinions of their friends, family and colleagues. This is to get a better perspective of the situation and to come up with a better solution. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.\n\nWhen we have a problem in front of us, we often get confused about which way to go. If we try to solve the problem ourselves, there are chances that we might make a mistake and make the situation worse. Seeking multiple opinions can help us solve problems more effectively. When we have to make an important decision, we should take the advice of people who are well versed in that field. For example, suppose a person has to buy a car. The person will seek the opinions of his friends and colleagues. This can help him decide which car to buy. If he takes the advice of a car expert, he will be able to make a better choice.\n\nWhen we get different perspectives, we can compare and contrast them and come to a conclusion. For example, I was planning to buy a laptop. I asked my friends and colleagues about the best laptop which I could buy. I got different opinions from different people. Now, I could compare and contrast the features and the prices of the laptops and come to a conclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, we should seek multiple opinions when making a decision. This can help us come to a better conclusion. We should also take the advice of experts.",

    "Driverless cars are becoming a popular topic in the media and among scientists, who are currently researching the potential for driverless cars to be used in public transportation and for environmental purposes. While these cars are still in the testing phase, Google has been successful in testing a driverless taxi system that could be used in the future. The potential benefits and drawbacks of this system will be examined in this essay, with a focus on Google's efforts to create a driverless taxi system.\n\nThe most obvious benefit of a driverless taxi system is that it would be safer for passengers and pedestrians. While accidents involving driverless cars are inevitable, they would not be the result of human error. The cars would be safer because they would not be operated by humans; therefore, they would have the same reaction time as the computer that is controlling them. This would be especially beneficial in emergency situations, such as when a person is crossing the street and a car is approaching. The driverless car would be able to stop in time to avoid hitting the pedestrian.\n\nAnother advantage would be that driverless cars would reduce traffic congestion. This would be especially true in cities where there are many cars and a lot of traffic. In these situations, the driverless car would be able to find the quickest route to the destination and would not have to wait in traffic.\n\nA drawback of driverless cars is that they could be more expensive to buy and maintain than regular cars. While the technology to create driverless cars is still in the research phase, it is expected that they would be more expensive than regular cars in the future. This could be a problem for people who do not",
    "The Electoral College is the method by which the candidate for the US presidency is selected. It is a non-democratic method of selection, which means that it is not up to the general population of the USA to decide who will be the next president. The process is as follows: the electors are chosen in each state, the number of electors is equal to the number of Congress representatives. The electors then vote for the president and the vice president. The electors have to follow their state\u2019s election law, which means that they are not supposed to vote for any candidate other than the one who won in their state. The votes are sent to Washington DC, where the votes are counted.\n\nThe Electoral College was implemented in order to prevent a direct election of the president by the people. The founding fathers wanted to make sure that no candidate will win the election with a small margin.

The Electoral College is also seen as a safeguard against the election of a candidate who is not qualified for the presidency, because the electors will choose their own candidate.\n\nThe Electoral College has many critics, who claim that it is und",
    "Summer break plays an important role in students' academic life. Some students use this break to learn new skills or to invigorate their minds. Others spend their time on aimless activities. In this essay, I shall compare and contrast the effectiveness of teacher-based and student-based summer projects in maintaining students' academic engagement during summer break. I will consider factors such as student motivation, project difficulty, teacher involvement, and preparation for the next school year. Finally, I shall recommend which type of project would be most beneficial for students and teachers.\n\nGenerally, teacher-based projects are more effective than student-based projects in maintaining students' academic engagement during summer break. A teacher-based project is a project that is supervised by a teacher. In a teacher-based project, a teacher can provide necessary guidance to the students. Also, a teacher can evaluate the student's progress during the project. For example, last summer, I took part in a teacher-based project. In that project, a group of students and I made a model of a solar system. Our teacher provided us with necessary resources to make the model. Also, she helped us whenever we got stuck. We were able to complete the project on time. Hence, we were able to learn new things and maintain our academic engagement.\n\nStudent-based projects are less effective than teacher-based projects in maintaining students' academic engagement during summer break. In a student-based project, students do not get any guidance from a teacher. They have to find their own resources and solve their own problems. In a student-based project, students have to be self-motivated. If they are not self-motivated, they will not be able to complete the project. For example, last summer, I took part in a student-based project. In that project, a group of students and I made a model of a solar system. We had to find our own resources. We had to solve our own problems. However, we were not able to complete the project on time. Hence, we were not able to learn new things and maintain our academic engagement.\nLastly, I would like to recommend that students and teachers should participate in teacher-based projects during summer break. A teacher-based project is a more effective way of maintaining students' academic engagement during summer break. A teacher can provide necessary resources and guidance to the students. Also, a teacher can evaluate the student's progress during the project. Hence, I recommend that students and teachers should participate in teacher-based projects during summer break.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that a teacher-based project is more effective than a student-based project in maintaining students' academic engagement during summer break. A teacher-based project is a more effective way of maintaining students' academic engagement during summer break. A teacher can provide necessary resources and guidance to the students. Also, a teacher can evaluate the student's progress during the project. Hence, I recommend that students and teachers should participate in teacher-based projects during summer break.",

    "A school is a place where students are taught to become responsible citizens. In order to develop a student\u2019s personality, the school must have certain rules and regulations. In my opinion, students must maintain a minimum grade of C in order to participate in extracurricular activities such as sports or band. The following paragraphs will explain the potential benefits and drawbacks of this change and my opinion on this change.\nFirstly, students will become responsible citizens if they are aware of the rules and regulations of the school. If they are not aware of the rules and regulations, they may not behave properly in the school premises.

    "Summer projects are a great way for students to enhance their skills and knowledge. There are many reasons why student-designed summer projects are more enjoyable and creative than teacher-designed projects. I would like to explain them in the following paragraphs, and then I will give some examples of fun and creative projects that students could design.\n\nThe first reason why student-designed summer projects are more enjoyable and creative than teacher-designed projects is that students can choose what they want to learn. As a result, they can choose the project that they are interested in, and they will be more motivated to do it. For example, my friend, Ben, decided to learn how to make a film. He spent a lot of time researching and experimenting, and finally made a short film, which he entered in a competition, and won the first prize. It was a project that he was interested in, and he had a lot of fun doing it.\n\nThe second reason why student-designed summer projects are more enjoyable and creative than teacher-designed projects is that learning happens in the process of creating. When students design their own projects, they have to learn a lot of skills that are related to their project. For example, Ben had to learn how to use a camera, and he also had to learn how to edit the film. He learned a lot of new skills, and it was a lot of fun for him.\n\nThe third reason why student-designed summer projects are more enjoyable and creative than teacher-designed projects is that students can choose their own resources. They can choose what tools, materials, and equipment they need for their project. For example, Ben chose the camera, tripod, and editing software that he wanted to use. He was able to choose the resources that he needed for his project, and he was able to create the project that he wanted.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons why student-designed summer projects are more enjoyable and creative than teacher-designed projects.

    "In today\u2019s fast-paced world, distance learning is an increasingly popular option for students who want to earn a degree or certificate. Distance learning has several benefits over traditional classroom education, including increased options for class times, reduced stress levels, and more personal time. However, it is important to consider the potential impact on time management skills and overall academic success.\n\nFirst, distance learning offers students increased options for class times. Traditional campus classes are usually offered during the workweek, during the day, and in the evening. They are often limited to a few hours each day, and it can be difficult for a student who works full-time to attend classes at that time. Distance learning can be done from home at any time of day or night. Students can attend classes whenever it is convenient for them. This means that they can continue to work their full-time jobs and still take classes for a degree or certificate.\n\nSecond, distance learning allows students to take classes in the comfort of their own homes. This means that they can avoid the stress of commuting to and from campus. This can be especially beneficial for students who live far from campus or who are unable to drive by themselves. Distance learning can be done from home, which can reduce stress levels and allow students to focus more on their studies.\n\nThird, distance learning allows students to have more personal time. Students who attend classes on campus are often under pressure to be in class at a certain time. They may have to wait in line to get into the classroom or they may have to sit through long lectures in order to get the information they need. With distance learning, students can choose when they want to attend classes. They do not have to worry about being late or missing class because they were too busy with work or other commitments. Distance learning gives students the freedom to study when it is convenient for them, which can lead to better grades and increased academic success.\n\nHowever, distance learning does have some drawbacks. For example, it requires students to be self-motivated and disciplined in order to succeed. Students must be able to manage their time effectively and stay on top of their studies in order to complete their courses. Distance learning courses are often more difficult than traditional classroom courses, so students must be willing to put in extra effort in order to succeed.\n\nIn conclusion, distance learning has many benefits for students, including increased options for class times, reduced stress levels, and more personal time. However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks before enrolling in a distance learning program. Students must be willing to put in extra effort and manage their time effectively in order to succeed.\n\n[Essay] Can you please assess my essay?\n\nBy vikram \u00b7 19/07/2012\n\nHi, I am taking IELTS in a few days and I need to get a band score of 7.

    "It is undeniable that Venus is a planet that is full of mysteries, including the reason why its temperature is so high. This article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), discusses the possibility of Venus being earth-like in the past and the potential for human habitation in the future. The author's argument for studying Venus is that the knowledge of Venus can be used to answer many questions about our solar system, and that it can help us to better understand the Earth. The author provides evidence to support this argument, including the possibility of Venus being earth-like in the past and the potential for human habitation in the future. However, the author does not provide any evidence that the knowledge of Venus could be used to answer many questions about our solar system. In addition, he does not explain how the knowledge of Venus can help us to better understand the Earth. The effectiveness of the author's persuasive techniques include providing evidence to support the argument, using informal language, and using an analogy.

    "Cell phones are a regular part of our life. We use them to contact our friends and family members, to take pictures, to access the internet, and to play games. We use them everywhere, even when we are driving. However, should we be allowed to use our cell phones while driving? I believe that we shouldn\u2019t. Using a cell phone while driving is dangerous for the driver and for everyone else on the road. Using a cell phone while driving can have negative consequences for both the driver and for the passengers in the car. If a person is using a cell phone while driving, he or she is not focused on the road. This causes the driver to be distracted and has the potential to cause an accident. In addition, texting while driving is even more dangerous because it requires the driver to take his or her eyes off the road for a longer period of time. The driver is not able to see what is happening around him or her. If the driver needs to stop quickly, he or she may not be able to do so in time. In addition, texting while driving can cause the driver to be inattentive and to miss important cues about what is happening on the road. In addition to being dangerous for the driver, texting while driving is dangerous for everyone else on the road. The driver\u2019s inattentiveness can cause him or her to miss signs and signals that other drivers are giving. If a driver is not paying attention, he or she may not see a stop sign or a red light. The driver may not be able to avoid hitting another car or pedestrian on the road. In addition, texting while driving can cause a driver to swerve into another lane and cause an accident. There are many potential dangers of texting while driving. However, if texting while driving is banned, then people would not be able to use their cell phones while driving. This would make the roads safer for everyone. People may be upset about the inconvenience of not being able to use their cell phones while driving. However, the benefits of banning texting while driving greatly outweigh the inconvenience. In conclusion, I believe that texting while driving should be banned. People should not use their cell phones while driving. It is dangerous for the driver and for everyone else on the road. It is inconvenient for drivers to not be able to use their",

    "In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, decision-making is becoming a challenging task. In order to make the best choices, it is important to seek advice from multiple sources to gain different perspectives of a particular issue. This essay will discuss the benefits of seeking advice from multiple sources and will also provide examples of how different perspectives can help in decision-making. Finally, the importance of considering the credibility and intentions of those providing advice will be discussed.\n\nFirstly, seeking advice from multiple sources can help in decision-making by providing different perspectives of a particular issue. Different perspectives can help people to see different sides to an issue and to understand the situation from a new angle. For example, when a person is planning a new business venture, it would be beneficial to seek advice from business consultants, who can provide an objective and professional point of view. This perspective could help the person to see the venture in a new light and to understand the risks involved. Additionally, seeking advice from trusted friends and family members can also help to provide different perspectives. For example, a friend could provide a personal perspective on the venture, which could be important in making the decision to proceed. In this way, seeking advice from multiple sources can help in decision-making by providing different perspectives.\n\nSecondly, seeking advice from multiple sources can help in decision-making by providing new ideas and solutions. For example, when a person is planning a new business venture, seeking advice from business consultants could help the person to find new solutions to problems, such as financial difficulties and competition from other businesses. This could help the person to find a way to overcome these problems and to ensure the success of the venture. Additionally, seeking advice from friends and family could help to generate new ideas that could be useful in the venture. For example, a friend could suggest a new marketing strategy that could help the person to reach a wider audience. In this way, seeking advice from multiple sources can help in decision-making by providing new ideas and solutions.\n\nLastly, it is important to consider the credibility and intentions of those providing advice. For example, when seeking advice from business consultants, it is important to consider the credibility of the consultant. This is because there are many people who claim to be business consultants but do not have the knowledge and experience required. Additionally, it is important to consider the intentions of those providing advice. For example, if a friend or family member is providing advice, it is important to consider their intentions. This is because they may have their own agenda and may not have the best interests of the person in mind. In this way, it is important to consider the credibility and intentions of those providing advice.\n\nIn conclusion, seeking advice from multiple sources can help in decision-making by providing different perspectives, new ideas and solutions. However, it is important to consider the credibility and intentions of those providing advice.\n\n(586 words)\n\n4.5\n\n(2 votes)\n\nComments\n\nThe essay is very well written, but there are a few things that you could improve on. First of all, it is quite repetitive in parts. For example, you mention that seeking advice from multiple sources can help in decision-making multiple times, but it is not necessary to mention this in each paragraph. Second, you could expand on some of your points by providing more examples or explaining why certain things are important. Finally, you could add a conclusion at the end of the essay to wrap up all your ideas.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\n",
    "Distance learning has been implemented in schools to benefit students by allowing them to attend classes from home and prevent additional days at the end of the year due to weather, as well as help them stay on track with school work and not fall behind due to an illness or family situation. Distance learning is a great way to teach students, but there are some disadvantages to this type of learning. Distance learning can be implemented in schools through online or video conferencing and the benefits that come with it.\n\nDistance learning can be implemented in schools through online or video conferencing.

    "In the 21st century, living in a car-reduced community has become an increasingly popular lifestyle. This new way of living has come about due to the efforts of the Environmental Protection Agency and legislators in promoting \"car reduced\" communities. In addition, due to the rebranding of companies like Ford and Mercedes as \"mobility\" companies, residents are more open to the idea of giving up their cars.\nIn the United States, there are many communities that have been reconfigured to either be car-reduced or car-free. One of the most well-known examples is Vauban, a suburb of the city of Freiburg in Germany. Vauban was built in 2000 to be a car-free community, where residents could walk or bike to their destinations. Since its conception, Vauban has been a huge success, attracting over 4000 residents. The car-free lifestyle of Vauban has been so successful that numerous other communities have adopted this lifestyle. In the United States, there is a community in Portland, Oregon called Sellwood, which is also car-free. In addition, there is a community in Seattle called Queen Anne, which is car-reduced.\nThe car-reduced lifestyle has been a huge success in Europe and the United States. However, the car-reduced lifestyle has not only been beneficial to the environment, but also to the residents. The residents of Vauban and Sellwood have been able to save money by not buying a car. In addition, since Vauban and Sellwood are car-reduced, the residents have been able to exercise more, which has led to decreased obesity rates in these communities. The car-reduced lifestyle also has a positive impact on the environment. In Vauban, the carbon emissions have decreased by 40%, due to the residents not owning a car. Since the residents of Vauban are able to walk or bike to their destinations, there has been a reduction in traffic. In addition, the residents of Vauban have been able to reduce their carbon emissions, due to the fact that they no longer need to drive to work.

    "Allowing students to use their phones at school can be detrimental to their learning and behavior in the classroom. This is because using phones can lead to disruptions, tardiness, and lack of attention in class. In addition, it can have negative consequences for the students such as getting bullied and having a low self-esteem.\n\nFirst of all, using phones can lead to disruptions in class. For instance, a student may play games on his phone that can distract him from his studies. This can affect his grades because he will not pay attention to his teacher and his work. Additionally, students may listen to music on their phones that can distract them from their studies. This can affect their grades because they will not pay attention to their teacher and their work.\n\nSecondly, using phones can lead to tardiness in class. For example, a student may check his phone during the first ten minutes of class. This can affect his grade because he will not be paying attention to his teacher and his work.\n\nLastly, using phones can lead to a lack of attention in class. For example, a student may chat with his friends on his phone during class. This can affect his grade because he will not be paying attention to his teacher and his work.

    "After the rapid development of information technology, the rapid spread of the Internet, and the widespread use of computers, the world is getting smaller and smaller. The \"Internet Plus\" has become the new normal. Many people have suggested that students take classes from home. I believe that taking classes from home has both advantages and disadvantages.\n\nTaking classes from home has many advantages. First, it can save a lot of time and energy. A student can save time and energy in commuting, and can use them to study. For example, students do not need to go to school on time and take public transportation, which saves a lot of time and energy. In addition, students can also use their spare time to do more things that they like. For example, students can take part-time jobs to make money and learn more things.\n\nOn the other hand, taking classes from home also has many disadvantages. First, the impact on students' mental and physical health. The main reason for this is that students are not used to staying at home for a long time, and they are physically and mentally lazy. Second, the impact on academic performance. If students do not go to school, they may not be able to be organized, which will affect their academic performance. Third, the impact on socialization skills. If students do not go to school, they will not be able to communicate with peers and their social skills will decline.\n\nIn conclusion, taking classes from home has both advantages and disadvantages.

    "The use of technology in reading and interpreting human emotions is a phenomenon that has been discussed for years. Although this technology has numerous benefits, it also has several drawbacks.\n\nOne of the benefits of using technology to read and interpret human emotions is that it can help to improve our understanding of the emotions of others. For example, in 2012, the Mona Lisa, a famous painting by Leonardo Da Vinci, was scanned. The resulting image revealed that the painting was not, as previously believed, of a woman with a sad expression on her face. Instead, it was of a woman with a smile on her face. This is an example of the potential benefits of using technology to read and interpret human emotions.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of using technology to read and interpret human emotions is that it can be very expensive and time-consuming.

The electoral college is a system that was created to represent each state equally, regardless of the population of the state. The electoral college system is flawed as it does not elect the president of the United States based on the popular vote, which is the direct vote of the citizens.

    "The electoral college is an institution that was created by the first constitution of the United States in 1789. This institution is widely used in the United States for electing the President and Vice-President. According to the constitution, the electors are chosen by each state and their number is equal to the number of representatives and senators in the respective state. The electors of the electoral college are chosen by the political parties and it is not a direct election. The elector vote is cast on the first Monday after the second Wednesday of December in the year of the presidential election. However, the electoral college should be abolished and replaced with a direct election of the President and Vice-President. By doing so, the US would be able to elect the President and Vice-President directly from the population, which is the most democratic way to elect the President and Vice-President. In addition, by doing so, the winner of the popular vote would be the winner of the election, which is the democratic way to elect the President and Vice-President.

    "Summer projects are a big part of our education system. They are assigned to students at the end of a school year to keep students engaged in learning over the summer. Some students find summer projects very interesting and enjoyable, whereas others find it stressful and monotonous. In this essay, I will discuss whether summer projects should be designed by teachers or students and what are the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. I will also discuss how students can be motivated to continue their learning and growth over the summer months and how schools can ensure that summer projects are both educational and enjoyable for students.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that summer projects should be designed by teachers.

    "While the traditional method of teaching in schools has remained the same for centuries, the advent of technology has led to the development of new methods of learning. Distance learning is a method of learning that allows people to learn from any place at any time. Distance learning sometimes referred to as online learning, is a method of teaching that utilizes technology to teach students in a virtual or online environment. Distance learning is becoming increasingly popular in schools as it can help meet the needs of different types of students. However, there are both benefits and drawbacks to distance learning in schools. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of distance learning in schools and examine the impact on students who may not have access to the necessary technology and the potential for increased stress levels. I will also consider the importance of human interaction and the development of life skills in the education process and provide examples to support my argument.\n\nDistance learning in schools provides an opportunity for students to learn at their own pace. In a traditional classroom, all students are expected to learn at the same pace. However, some students may need extra time to learn new concepts while some may find it easy to understand the concepts. In distance learning, students are given the opportunity to learn at their own pace. This helps students who may need extra time to learn new concepts and learn more effectively. For example, students who have learning disabilities may require extra time to learn a concept and find it difficult to learn in a traditional classroom. Distance learning allows them to learn at their own pace and learn the concept at a pace that is most comfortable for them. In addition, distance learning allows students to learn at a time that is most convenient for them. For example, students who have a day job may be able to learn at night after work. This helps students who may not be able to learn during the day due to work commitments. In addition, distance learning allows students to learn from any place at any time. For example, students who have a day job may not be able to attend classes during the day but can learn at night after work. This helps students who may not be able to attend classes during the day due to work commitments. In addition, distance learning allows students to learn from any place at any time. For example, students who have a day job may not be able to attend classes during the day but can learn at night after work. This helps students who may not be able to attend classes during the day due to work commitments.\n\nDistance learning has many benefits. However, there are some drawbacks to distance learning in schools. The first drawback is that students who may not have access to the necessary technology may not be able to learn effectively. For example, students who do not have a computer may not be able to learn from a computer-based distance learning program. In addition, students who may not have access to the necessary technology may not be able to learn effectively.

    "While extracurricular activities are a key component of a student's life, the rules governing participation in these activities vary from school to school. Some schools require students to maintain a certain grade point average (GPA), while others do not.\n\nMaintaining a grade B average is a good idea for several reasons. First, it forces students to stay on top of their studies in order to keep their grade above a B. Second, it prevents students from skipping class and missing assignments in order to participate in extracurricular activities. Finally, requiring students to maintain a high grade average encourages them to stay focused on their ultimate goal, which is to graduate and go on to college.\n\nUnfortunately, there are also downsides to requiring students to maintain a high grade average. First, young people are already under a lot of stress and pressure, and the rules governing their participation in extracurricular activities can add to that stress. Second, students may not be able to participate in as many extracurricular activities as they wish if they are forced to maintain a high grade average.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to requiring students to maintain a certain grade average, it ultimately makes sense to place these restrictions on students, as it will help them stay focused and motivated to do well in school.\n\nI appreciate your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMe\n\nI appreciate any feedback, whether positive or negative.

    "The use of self-driving cars is a controversial topic, with many people arguing that it is a good idea, and others stating that it would be a disaster. In this essay, I will argue that self-driving cars are not a good idea, and will provide three reasons to support that claim. Firstly, self-driving cars are not as safe as manually driven cars. Secondly, if there is a crash, the driver of the self-driving car will not be held responsible. Finally, if self-driving cars are implemented, the police will not be able to keep up with the increasing number of traffic violations.\n\nFirstly, self-driving cars are not as safe as manually driven cars. Self-driving cars have a tendency to make mistakes, as they do not always read the road correctly. When this happens, the driver has no way of knowing what to do. Secondly, if there is a crash, the driver of the self-driving car will not be held responsible. The manufacturer of the car will be responsible for any crashes that occur. Finally, if self-driving cars are implemented, the police will not be able to keep up with the increasing number of traffic violations. There will be a greater number of cars on the road, and police officers will have to work harder to catch people breaking the law.\n\nThese are the three main reasons why self-driving cars",
    "The idea of learning from home is becoming increasingly popular. It is being accepted by schools and students in many parts of the world. Although it has many benefits, it also has some drawbacks. In my opinion, this is one of the best ways to learn and a great opportunity for students of all ages to improve their education. \n\nThere are many advantages to learning from home. The most important one is that it saves a lot of time. Students do not have to travel to school, and they can save time by not having to get ready to go to school. Students can also learn in a more relaxed environment. They can take breaks when they need them, and there is no need to rush to get to school on time. Furthermore, students can learn at their own pace. They can take as long as they need to understand the material, and they can repeat lessons until they fully grasp them. They can also choose when they want to learn. If they are tired or sick, they can choose to take a day off, or they can learn at any time of the day or night. \n\nHowever, this method also has some drawbacks. The first one is that it can be lonely. Some students may feel isolated from their peers, and they may miss the social aspect of school. They may also miss the opportunity to interact with teachers and other students. In addition, it can be difficult for students to stay motivated. It may be hard for them to focus on their studies if they are not surrounded by other students. Furthermore, it may be difficult for students to stay organized. They may forget to do their homework or turn in their assignments on time. They may also lose track of what they have learned, which can be frustrating. \n\nIn conclusion, learning from home is a good way to improve education. It has many benefits, but it also has some drawbacks. It is important to weigh the pros and cons of this method before deciding whether to use it. \n\nThank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon. \n\nYours sincerely, \n\n[Name]\n\n[Address]\n\n[Phone number]\n\n[Email address]\n\nOP: Thank you so much for your help!\n\ni67nolas: You're very welcome!

    "The modern world is becoming more and more dependent on cars. Even though they offer many benefits, they cause many problems, such as air pollution, global warming, and traffic congestion. In my opinion, it is necessary to reduce car usage and promote alternative transportation methods to overcome these issues. However, we should first consider the benefits of car usage to determine whether there are any disadvantages to reducing car usage.\n\nCars are a convenient way to get from one place to another and provide a sense of independence and freedom. In some cities, cars are the only way to get around, especially in countries such as the United States where public transportation is not very efficient. Additionally, cars make it easier for people to move heavy objects, such as furniture, and are often the only way for people to transport large amounts of goods. Finally, cars can save time and money. By driving, people avoid the expense of public transportation and can save time by avoiding the inconvenience of waiting for a bus or train.\n\nHowever, cars are also a major cause of pollution and global warming. Every day, millions of cars pollute the air by emitting harmful chemicals such as carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide. In addition, cars have a large carbon footprint because they use a lot of fossil fuel and contribute to deforestation. Moreover, cars cause traffic congestion, which makes it difficult for people to get to work on time and can cause accidents. Finally, cars can damage the environment and cause health problems for people who live close to roads. For example, in some cities, people who live near busy roads have higher chances of developing cancer than people who live farther away from roads.\n\nIn conclusion, cars are a convenient way to get around, but they also cause many problems, such as pollution and traffic congestion. To reduce these problems, I think it is necessary to promote alternative transportation methods, such as bicycles and public transportation. In addition, we should also consider reducing the number of cars on the road by introducing carpooling and a congestion charge. However, there are some challenges to reducing car usage, such as the expense of public transportation and the lack of parking spaces. Therefore, I think it is important to consider the benefits of car usage before we decide to reduce car usage.\n\nPlease let me know if I have any mistakes in my essay. Thank you so much for your help :)\n\nHi,\n\nYour essay is a little bit too long but that's okay, I can still help you.

    "The planet Venus has been called Earth's \"sister planet\", due to the fact that Venus is similar to Earth in size, mass, density, and bulk composition. However, while Venus and Earth are similar in their basic composition, they are very different in terms of their environments. In this essay, I will discuss the challenges and potential for exploration of Venus, including its history as a potentially Earth-like planet and the dangers posed by its atmosphere and surface conditions.\n\nThe largest challenge for exploration of Venus is the dense atmosphere that surrounds the planet. This atmosphere is composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and trace amounts of other gases. The atmosphere of Venus is 90 times more dense than the atmosphere of Earth, with a surface pressure of 92 bar. Additionally, the temperature is high, reaching around 450 degrees Celsius at the surface. This is due to the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere, which traps heat radiated from the planet. The high pressure and temperature of the atmosphere make it difficult to send spacecraft to Venus, and the conditions make surface exploration extremely dangerous. However, the dense atmosphere of Venus does present the possibility of using aerobraking, in which the spacecraft's speed is slowed down by the atmosphere, to enter into Venus's orbit. To do this, the spacecraft would need to be very sturdy and well-designed, as it would need to survive the high pressures of the atmosphere, as well as the high temperatures. \n\nVenus has a very rich history as a potentially Earth-like planet. The planet Venus was formed around 4.5 billion years ago, and it is believed to have had a similar history to Earth during its early years. Venus has a relatively young surface, which is only about 600 million years old. This surface is covered in volcanoes, lava flows, and impact craters",

The U.S. is the second oldest constitutional democracy in the world after the United Kingdom. The presidential election process in the U.S. is a complex system that is based on the Electoral College. This system has been in place since the U.S. constitution was ratified in 1788. The Electoral College is a body of electors who are elected by the citizens of the U.S. to elect the president and the vice president of the United States. The Electoral College was created by the framers of the U.S. constitution to ensure that the president would be elected by the representatives of the states.

    "Summer assignments are a big part of the learning process, but they can take up a lot of time and cause a lot of stress. They can also be a big problem for students who are preparing for a big exam, or who are taking a class that they don't need. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of summer assignments, as well as the problems that they cause, and how we can improve them so that they're more beneficial for everyone involved.\n\nFirst, let's look at the benefits of summer assignments. Summer assignments give students an opportunity to develop critical thinking skills, which is very important for their future success in school. They also give students a chance to explore new ideas and learn about the world around them. Students who do well on summer assignments may find that they're more prepared for class because they've learned about the topics before they even start studying them. Finally, they give students a chance to practice and improve their writing skills, which is always a good thing!\n\nNext, let's talk about the problems that summer assignments cause. One problem is that students don't want to do them because they're boring or difficult. Another problem is that some students copy from each other, which isn't fair to those who actually did the work. Finally, there are some students who don't do well on the assignments because they don't understand them or because they don't have time to complete them all before school starts again. These problems can all be solved with just a little bit of planning and preparation!\n\nFinally, let's talk about how we can improve summer assignments. One way to improve them is to make them more interesting and engaging for students. For example, instead of just having them read a book or watch a movie, try giving them an assignment that involves doing something creative like writing an essay or creating a project. Another way to improve them is to make them shorter. For example, if you want to give students a writing assignment, try giving them only one paragraph to write instead of the usual five! Finally, you can also make summer assignments more challenging by giving students more difficult assignments such as an essay or project that requires more research or deeper thinking.\n\nIn conclusion, summer assignments are an important part of the learning process, but they can cause a lot of problems for students. With just a little bit of planning and preparation, however, they can be made more beneficial for everyone involved. This essay has discussed the benefits of summer assignments, as well as the problems that they cause, and how we can improve them so that they're more beneficial for everyone involved.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nMaxxie\n",

    "Using a cell-phone while driving is a problem that has been around for a long time. Although some people insist that it is a major distraction, others argue that the benefits of using a cell-phone while driving outweigh the risks. In this essay, I will discuss the issue of cell-phone use while driving, including the consequences it can lead to and the laws and features that have been implemented to address it. I will also consider the various reasons why people use their cell-phones while driving and the potential solutions to this issue.\n\nFirst of all, there are many risks of using a cell-phone while driving. One of the most important of these is that it can distract a driver and cause them to take their attention off the road. This can lead to accidents and injuries. Another risk is that it can make a driver more tired, because they have to focus on the conversation and on the road. This can also cause accidents.\n\nThere are many laws that have been implemented to address this problem. For example, some countries have banned the use of cell-phones while driving.

    "It is a well known fact that students who fail in class but excel in sports or other extra-curricular activities are not given much importance. In this essay, I would like to highlight the importance of extracurricular activities in addition to academic achievement as well as the ways by which schools can balance the importance of both.\n\nSchools can balance the importance of academic achievement with the benefits of extracurricular activities by encouraging these students to focus on their studies and giving them extra time to study. Furthermore, schools can also hold special tutorials and provide additional coaching to these students, in order to help them improve their academic performance.\n\nIn addition to this, schools can also encourage these students to actively participate in extra-curricular activities, in order to give them a sense of self-worth. These activities will also help them to develop their personality and enhance their skills. It is a known fact that students who excel in sports or other extra-curricular activities have a better chance of getting admission into reputed colleges and universities.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to say that schools should focus on the academic achievement of these students, in addition to the extra-curricular activities. They should also encourage these students to participate in extra-curricular activities, in order to enhance their skills and personality.\n\nWord count: 199\n\nThank you very much for your time.\nYours sincerely,\nAnonymous\n\n",

    "The question of whether teachers should assign summer projects to students or whether students should be allowed to choose their own topics for summer projects is a controversial one. While some believe that students should be given the freedom to choose their own topics, others argue that teachers should assign summer projects to students. I agree with the latter view, and believe that teachers should assign summer projects to students. I will explain my reasons for this belief below.\n\nTo begin with, it is important for teachers to assign summer projects to students because it helps students to develop their thinking and research skills. If teachers were to allow students to choose their own topics for summer projects, many students would choose topics that are not challenging enough to help them develop their research skills. In such cases, students would not gain any meaningful skills from their summer projects. On the other hand, if teachers assign summer projects, students will be forced to tackle challenging topics, which will help them to develop their research skills. Furthermore, if teachers assign summer projects, students will not have to spend time choosing a topic before they begin their summer project, which means that they will have more time to focus on actually completing their summer project. This is especially important for students, as it will help them to develop their time management skills.\n\nAnother reason why teachers should assign summer projects to students is that it helps students to develop their time management skills. If students were to be allowed to choose their own topics for summer projects, many students would spend a lot of time choosing a topic before they begin their summer project. This would waste a lot of time, and make it difficult for students to complete their summer project in time for the summer break. On the other hand, if teachers assign summer projects, students will not have to spend time choosing a topic before they begin their summer project, which means that they will have more time to focus on actually completing their summer project.

    "I strongly believe that summer learning activities should be teacher-designed, not student-designed. I am of the opinion that the students can achieve the best results when the teachers design the summer learning projects. In this essay, I will explain why I feel that the students should have teacher-designed summer learning projects and how these projects benefit students in their academic and personal growth.\n\nFirstly, the teachers are the most appropriate people to design the summer learning projects. They are the ones who understand the students\u2019 needs and capabilities. They are the ones who know how to make the learning activities interesting and engaging. They are the ones who can motivate the students to participate in the activities. They are the ones who can keep the students on track.

The teachers are the ones who can teach the students the required skills. The teachers are the ones who can help the students develop their skills. The teachers are the ones who can help the students become better learners. The teachers are the ones who can help the students become more successful in their academic and personal lives.\n\nFinally, the teachers can make the learning activities more engaging and interesting. The teachers can make the summer learning activities more interesting by using different learning styles and approaches.

Other people prefer to prepare and eat food at home. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of obtaining food. Which way of obtaining food do you prefer? Give reasons for your preference.\n\nWrite at least 250 words.\n\nModel Answer 1:\n\nNowadays, there are many ways to get food, and many people have their own preferences. Some prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants, while others prefer to prepare and eat food at home. Personally, I also prefer to prepare and eat food at home but I also enjoy going out occasionally.\n\nFirstly, eating at home is much cheaper than eating outside.

    "The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in extracurricular activities should be granted to students, for the following reasons:\n\nFirstly, students should be allowed to choose their own activities because they are more likely to be interested in them. For example, if students are required to take part in a sport, and they do not like it, they will be reluctant to do so and will not perform well. This is because they will not be motivated to participate in the activity, as they do not enjoy it.\n\nSecondly, students should be allowed to choose their own activities because they are more likely to be committed to the activity.

    "Cars are a common sight in major cities around the world. Although there are many advantages of using cars, there are also negative effects. In this essay, I will explain the negative impact of cars on pollution in major cities and discuss potential solutions to reduce the amount of pollution caused by automobile engines.\n\nFirst, cars are one of the major causes of air pollution. According to the data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), the 20 most polluted cities in the world are located in China, India and other developing Asian countries. In addition, the WHO also states that 9 out of 10 people in the world are breathing polluted air, which results in many diseases, including lung cancer. In order to reduce the amount of air pollution, governments around the world have introduced a wide range of measures, including tax incentives for using electric cars and setting a speed limit in major cities.\n\nSecond, cars are also one of the major causes of noise pollution. According to the data provided by the World Health Organization, the 20 most noisy cities in the world are located in India and other developing Asian countries. In addition, the WHO also states that noise pollution is one of the most common forms of pollution in major cities, which results in many diseases, including hearing loss. In order to reduce the amount of noise pollution, governments around the world have introduced a wide range of measures, including prohibiting the use of noisy engines in residential areas and setting a speed limit in major cities.\n\nIn conclusion, although there are many disadvantages of using cars, there are also some measures that can be taken in order to reduce the amount of pollution caused by automobile engines. For example, governments can provide tax incentives for using electric cars and setting a speed limit in major cities.\n\nDear Peter,\nThank you very much for your comments.

    "Schools are a place where students should be learning in a distraction-free environment. Research has proven that cell phones negatively affect the learning environment. Schools should ban cell phones from the classrooms and allow them only in designated areas. Cell phones can distract students from their work, negatively affect grades, and cultivate a sense of disrespect among the student body.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with cell phones in school is that they distract students from their work. When a student is not paying attention, it is difficult for them to learn. If a student is not paying attention, they will not receive the information that they need to learn. As a result, students who use their cell phones during class will have a more difficult time learning the information, and will have to put in more effort to learn the information later. Students who use their cell phones during class will also have a more difficult time retaining the information that they do learn. This will make it difficult for them to pass tests, and will lead to lower grades.\n\nAnother problem with cell phones in school is that they can negatively affect grades. In addition to distracting students from their work, cell phones can also lead to students cheating on tests. Cheating can hurt grades, and can lead to a student being suspended or expelled. As a result, cell phones can have a negative impact on a student\u2019s grades, and can lead to a student failing a class.\n\nStill another problem with cell phones in school is that they can cultivate a sense of disrespect among the student body. Cell phones can lead to students not paying attention in class, and can lead to students cheating on tests. Students who use cell phones during class are not demonstrating the type of behavior that is necessary for school. As a result, students who use cell phones in class are not demonstrating the type of behavior that is necessary for school, and are not receiving the education that they need to become successful adults. The use of cell phones in school is a problem that must be addressed. Schools should ban cell phones from the classrooms and allow them only in designated areas.\n",

This policy has both potential benefits and drawbacks. However, I would argue that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and the policy should be implemented. \n\nMany students believe that a minimum B or C average requirement is unfair because it does not take into account students' effort. They also believe that students should be able to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities regardless of their grades. However, I would argue that a minimum B or C grade requirement is fair because it encourages students to work hard and not waste their time on extracurricular activities. Students who are not hardworking will be able to realize that they do not have the ability to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. Therefore, they will be able to focus on their studies. \n\nIn addition, many students believe that a minimum B or C grade requirement is unfair because it does not take into account students' effort.

The Electoral College is the body of electors who formally elect the president and vice president of the United States.

The Electoral College method does not represent the will of the people, as it is an indirect way to elect a president. Direct election would give voters the power to choose the president directly.

In the 2000 election, Al Gore won the popular vote, but George W. Bush won the Electoral College, and therefore, became the president. The Electoral College is not a fair and equitable way to elect the president, as it is not based on the majority vote of the people. Instead, the Electoral College is based on the popular vote of each state.

    "Many people nowadays are addicted to their cell phones. They use their cell phones while driving, which can result in fatal accidents. This essay will analyze the dangers of using cell phones while driving and the impact of technology on our daily lives. Furthermore, it will explain the reasons for distracted driving and the negative consequences of such actions. Finally, it will provide ways to prevent distracted driving and promote safe driving habits.\n\nTo begin with, using cell phones while driving is a major cause of distracted driving, which can lead to fatal accidents. Many people nowadays are accustomed to using their cell phones in order to communicate with others. However, they are not aware of the dangers of using their cell phones while driving. In fact, using cell phones while driving can be dangerous because it can divert the attention of the driver from the road. This can lead to fatal accidents. For example, a driver might get into a fatal accident if he/she is talking on the phone while driving. In addition, the driver might be so engaged in texting on his/her cell phone that he/she might forget to stop at a red light. This might result in a collision with another vehicle, causing injuries and fatalities. As a result, using cell phones while driving can be dangerous and lead to fatal accidents.\n\nMoreover, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. Many people nowadays are more dependent on technology than in the past. For instance, they use their cell phones to communicate with others. In addition, they use their cell phones to share information with others. Furthermore, they use their cell phones to take pictures and videos.

    "Summer projects are a way of learning during the summer months. Students are encouraged to think about a topic of their choice either by themselves or with help from their teachers. The purpose of summer projects is to keep students active during the summer months, to encourage them to think about certain topics, to help them to develop their academic growth and to ensure that students do not forget what they have learnt in school. Students are required to do a project during the summer holidays, so that they can have a fun time during the summer months and at the same time learn something new. The summer projects can be teacher-designed or student-designed. There are certain advantages and disadvantages of both types of summer projects.\nOne of the advantages of teacher-designed summer projects is that teachers can easily guide the students in their projects. The teachers can provide the students with resources and materials that they need to complete their projects. The teacher will also be able to help the students in the planning of their projects and will be able to give them advice on the topic and the resources they need to use. The teacher will also be able to guide the students in the completion of their projects. This is the most important benefit of teacher-designed summer projects because the teachers will be able to help the students in their projects and will also be able to check their work and give them feedback. Another advantage of teacher-designed summer projects is that the students will not be able to cheat in their projects because their teachers will be able to check their work and give them feedback. This is because the teacher will be in charge of the project and will be able to check the work and give them feedback. The teacher will also be able to give the students advice on how to complete their projects. This is one of the most important advantages of teacher-designed projects because the students will be able to complete their projects without any help from the teachers and will also be able to learn something new. The teacher will also be able to give the students advice on how to complete their projects.

    "Extracurricular activities are an essential part of school life. However, some school administrators are considering making them mandatory in all schools. I firmly believe that this is a bad idea for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, extra curricular activities require space and equipment, which can be difficult for schools to find. Schools need to allocate space for these activities, and that space can be difficult to find. Most schools have a limited amount of space to spare. In addition, the equipment required for these activities can be very expensive. For example, a football team needs a line of scrimmage, a goal line, and footballs. Each of these items is expensive, and a school may not have the money to buy them.\n\nSecond, many schools have trouble finding enough transportation for their students. For example, a school may have to use several buses to get all of their students to and from their activities. If the school has to pay for all of these buses, the cost will be very high, and the school may not be able to afford to run the activities. Moreover, schools have to have drivers to drive the buses, and that can be difficult to do. For example, a school may not have enough bus drivers to take all of the students to their activities, and they may have to hire drivers from a private company. This can be expensive, and the school may not be able to afford to run the activities.\n\nFinally, schools should not make extra curricular activities mandatory because students should have the freedom to choose what activities they want to participate in. For example, a student may want to play football, but they may not be able to afford the equipment and the transportation. A school should not force a student to play football just because they are a student at that school. Students should be able to choose what activities they want to participate in, and they should be able to choose what activities they want to play in.\n\nIn conclusion, schools should not make extra curricular activities mandatory because they require space and equipment, they cost a lot of money, and students should be able to choose what activities they want to participate in.",
    "The Electoral College is a system that is meant to allow the American public to vote for the president. The process begins with the general election, where the citizens vote for the candidate they want to be president. The winner of the electoral college is the person who receives the most votes in the popular vote. This system is used in every presidential election, and it has worked well for the past 240 years. However, the Electoral College has recently come under scrutiny. Many people think that the Electoral College should be abolished, because it is unfair and undemocratic. I disagree with this point of view and I believe that the Electoral College should remain the deciding factor in choosing the president.\n\nFirst of all, the Electoral College is a system that was created by the Founding Fathers. The Electoral College was designed to make sure that the president was chosen by a group of people rather than just the majority. The founders wanted to make sure that if the majority of the people voted for a candidate, but that candidate was not qualified to be president, then the Electoral College would step in and choose someone who was more qualified. This system has worked well for the past 240 years. Even though the Electoral College is not perfect, it does work.\n\nSecondly, the Electoral College is fair. If the Electoral College was abolished, then it would mean that the majority of the people would choose the president. However, this would not be fair because not everyone in the country has a say in elections. If the Electoral College was abolished, then only the people who live in cities would have a say in who the next president is. This would not be fair because it would give more power to the people who live in cities than it would give to people who live in rural areas.\n\nFinally, the Electoral College is necessary because it ensures that the president is qualified and capable of being president. If the Electoral College was abolished, then it would mean that anyone could become president. This would not be fair because it would give more power to people who are not qualified to be president than it would",

The planet is named after the Roman god of war because of its red color. The planet is believed to have water and life. The planet is also famous for its face on Mars phenomenon, which is a landform on the planet's surface. Some people believe that the face is a natural landform while others believe that it is a product of human imagination.\n\nThe face on Mars is a landform that is believed to be the face of a human. The landform is in the Cydonia region of Mars. The face on Mars can be seen with the naked eye. The face has a nose, eyebrow, mouth, and an eye. The face has a size of 2.3 miles by 1.5 miles. The face has a slope of 35 degrees. The face is believed to be a natural landform because it was formed by a process of erosion.

    "Cell phones are a great invention. They make it easy to communicate with people, and they can also be used for educational purposes. However, they can also be very distracting and cause problems in the classroom. Therefore, I think that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, but they should be required to keep them turned off during class time.\n\nFirst of all, cell phones can be very distracting in the classroom. When students are using their phones, they are not paying attention to the teacher. This can cause them to miss important information and can also be disrespectful to the teacher.\n\nSecondly, students are often using their phones to play games, watch videos, or send text messages. This creates a noisy environment and makes it difficult for the teacher to get the students\u2019 attention.\n\nFinally, some students use their phones to cheat on tests and assignments. This creates an unfair playing field for those who are not cheating. In addition, it creates an unsafe environment because students are not paying attention to what is happening around them.\n\nOn the other hand, cell phones have many benefits. They can be used to call for help in an emergency, and they can also be used to contact parents",
    "Though the idea of limiting car usage in order to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation is a good idea, it has both advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this idea, and I will use examples from Paris and Colombia to support my argument and address the issue of affordability for those who rely on cars as their primary mode of transportation.\n\nFirst of all, limiting car usage in order to reduce smog is a good idea because it will not only improve the environment, but it will also improve the health of the people who live in the city. In Colombia, for example, many people suffer from respiratory problems. This is because of the high levels of smog in the air. By limiting car usage, and promoting the use of alternative transportation, such as bicycles, Colombia will be able to reduce the amount of smog in the air, which will improve the health of the people who live there.\n\nOn the other hand, limiting car usage in order to reduce smog is a disadvantage for people who rely on cars as their primary mode of transportation. For example, in Paris, people rely on cars because it is the quickest and easiest way to get from one place to another. If they are not allowed to use their cars, they will have to wait for the metro or the bus, which can be very time consuming. Therefore, limiting car usage will cause people to spend more time waiting for the metro or the bus, which will be very inconvenient for them.\n\nIn conclusion, though limiting car usage in order to reduce smog is a good idea, it has both advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I have discussed the benefits and drawbacks of this idea, and I have used examples from Paris and Colombia to support my argument and address the issue of affordability for those who rely on cars as their primary mode of transportation.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nBest Regards,\nGianluca\n\nDear Mr. Gianluca,\n\nThank you for choosing Oxford Seminars for your TESOL/TESL/TEFL Certification Course.

    "The world is going through a significant change. The third world era has brought new challenges and opportunities for everyone. People are experiencing new problems that require new solutions. To solve these problems, it is important that individuals seek advice from multiple sources. This essay will discuss the importance of seeking advice from multiple sources and provide examples of how listening to different opinions can help individuals see their problems in a new light and ultimately lead to better solutions. Additionally, this essay will discuss the potential drawbacks of only seeking advice from one person and the benefits of seeking advice from professionals.\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s important to seek advice from multiple sources because many people have different perspectives on the same problem. An example of this can be seen in the story of the three blind men and an elephant. Each blind man felt a different part of the elephant. The man who touched the elephant\u2019s tail thought the elephant was a snake, the man who touched the elephant\u2019s leg thought the elephant was a tree, and the man who touched the elephant\u2019s ear thought the elephant was a fan. The blind men were all wrong because they did not see the whole picture. Similarly, when we face a problem, we may have a specific perspective on the issue that may be incorrect. For example, if I am having trouble with my friends, I might think that they are the problem. However, if I discuss the issue with my mother, she might tell me that I am the problem. If I discuss the issue with my father, he might tell me that our friends are the problem. By seeking advice from multiple sources, I might come to the conclusion that I am the problem and that I need to change my behavior.\n\nSecondly, it\u2019s important to seek advice from multiple sources because new ideas can be generated when we listen to different opinions. For example, if I am a doctor and I am treating a patient, I might think that the patient\u2019s illness is caused by a virus. However, if I discuss the patient\u2019s symptoms with my friend, who is a pharmacist, he might tell me that the patient\u2019s illness is caused by a fungus. By seeking advice from my friend, I might discover a new idea that could help the patient.\n\nThirdly, it\u2019s important to seek advice from multiple sources because advice from professionals can be helpful. For example, if I am having financial problems, I might go to a friend for advice. However, my friend might not have the skills to give me good financial advice. If I go to a financial advisor instead, he can help me solve my financial problems.\n\nIn conclusion, it\u2019s important to seek advice from multiple sources because many people have different perspectives on the same problem. New ideas can be generated when we listen to different opinions, and advice from professionals can be helpful. Although seeking advice from only one person can be easier, it can lead to incorrect ideas and poor solutions to problems. Therefore, it\u2019s better to seek advice from multiple sources.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike \n\nRelated\n\n\u2190 3rd World Essay",
    "Homeschooling is a controversial topic that has been debated for a long time. Although it has some disadvantages, homeschooling is a better option for students who struggle with social anxiety or have other difficulties working in a traditional classroom setting. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of homeschooling for students who have social anxiety or other difficulties working in a traditional classroom setting.\n\nFirst, one of the main advantages of homeschooling is that students can work at home. Therefore, they don\u2019t have to face the social anxiety that comes from being around other students. For example, if a student has social anxiety, they can avoid the anxiety that comes with being in a classroom full of other students. This is beneficial for students who struggle with social anxiety.\n\nAdditionally, another advantage of homeschooling is that parents can help their children with their education. This is especially important for students who struggle with social anxiety or other difficulties working in a traditional classroom setting. For example, if a student has social anxiety, they can avoid the anxiety that comes with being in a classroom full of other students. This is beneficial for students who struggle with social anxiety.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some disadvantages to homeschooling. One disadvantage is that it is difficult for students to socialize with other students. For example, if a student has social anxiety, they can avoid the anxiety that comes with being in a classroom full of other students. This is beneficial for students who struggle with social anxiety.\n\nAnother disadvantage is that parents must be involved in their children\u2019s education. For example, if a student has social anxiety, they can avoid the anxiety that comes with being in a classroom full of other students. This is beneficial for students who struggle with social anxiety.\n\nTo sum up, although homeschooling has some disadvantages",
    "The use of cell phones while driving has become a major behavior that has gained the attention of the public. Although the use of cell phones while driving has become a very common behavior especially among the youth, it is a behavior that is dangerous and has caused many deaths. Driving while on the phone is a major distraction to drivers and should be discouraged. The use of phones while driving should be discouraged by enforcing stricter laws and penalties.\n\nFirst, there is little doubt that the use of cell phones while driving is a distraction. Many studies have shown that the use of cell phones while driving is a distraction that causes many deaths among drivers. In fact, the number of deaths caused by the use of cell phones while driving is high. In the United States alone, more than 3,000 deaths have been caused by the use of cell phones while driving. This number is alarming and should be the reason behind the need for stricter laws and penalties to discourage the use of cell phones while driving.\n\nSecond, the use of cell phones while driving is also dangerous. It is worth noting that the use of cell phones while driving has been a major cause of accidents. In fact, the use of cell phones while driving has been the main cause of accidents in the United States. This is evident by the fact that the number of accidents that have been caused by using cell phones while driving has increased.

    "The number of students who participate in sports and extracurricular activities has been increasing in recent years. Hence, it is crucial to find a way to help them manage their academic schedule and sports activities. In this essay, I will discuss three methods that schools can use to help student athletes prioritize their academic responsibilities while still participating in sports and extracurricular activities.\n\nThe first method that schools can use to help student athletes prioritize their academic responsibilities is to make sure that their academic schedule is flexible enough to accommodate their sports activities. For instance, there are high school students who have a sports class during the day and then practice for two hours or more afterwards. If they have a quiz or a test, they have to take it before or after practice. This arrangement is not ideal because it prevents them from concentrating on their studies. Therefore, schools can make their academic schedule more flexible by allowing students to take tests at any time during the day. They can also make sure that students have enough time to study before a test by giving them extra days off from school or by allowing them to take online tests.\n\nThe second method that schools can use to help student athletes prioritize their academic responsibilities is to make sure that they have enough time to study during school hours. For instance, a high school student who is taking a math class may have a quiz or a test during the day. If this student is also participating in a sports activity, he/she may not have enough time to study for the test. Therefore, schools can make sure that students have enough time to study by giving them extra days off from school or by allowing them to take online tests. They can also make sure that students have enough time to study by giving them extra time during the day to study.\n\nThe third method that schools can use to help student athletes prioritize their academic responsibilities is to make sure that they have enough time to study during school",

    "The Electoral College is a system that elects the president of the United States. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and to be elected president, the candidate must receive a majority of 270 Electoral College votes.\n\nThe advantages of the Electoral College system are that it protects the interests of small states, it provides a balance between the popular vote and the Electoral College vote and it is a safeguard against the tyranny of the majority. The disadvantages of the Electoral College system are that the candidates focus on the swing states, it is possible that the winner of the popular vote does not win the election and it is possible that the candidate with the most votes does not become president.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that the Electoral College system should be changed to a popular vote system.

The first autonomous vehicle was developed in 1980. Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. In 2014, the first autonomous car was sold. In 2015, Google announced their self-driving car project. The company\u2019s goal is to eliminate traffic accidents. Many companies are developing autonomous cars, such as Nissan, BMW, and Audi. Some people believe that driverless cars are a good idea. They claim that the cars will be safer, more efficient, and more convenient. However, others argue that driverless cars are a bad idea. They say that the cars will be unsafe, expensive, and dangerous.\n\nThere are many reasons why people think driverless cars are a good idea. The cars will be safer because they will not be driven by a human. The cars will be more efficient because they will be programmed to drive on the most efficient route. Also, the cars will be more convenient because they will allow people to do work or relax while driving. For example, a person could work on his computer while riding in a car. Another reason why people think driverless cars are a good idea is that they will be cheaper. This is because the cars do not have a driver.\n\nHowever, there are also many reasons why people think driverless cars are a bad idea. The cars will be unsafe because they will not be able to respond to dangerous situations. For example, a driverless car might not be able to avoid a car that is on fire.

    "The Electoral College should be replaced with election by popular vote for the president of the United States because the winner-take-all system is unfair, the outdated and irrational nature of the Electoral College is detrimental to the country, and the potential for ties to be handled unprofessionally is dangerous.\n\nFirst of all, the winner-take-all system is unfair. For example, in the 2000 election, George W. Bush won the election with 271 electoral votes, but Al Gore won the popular vote with 500,000 more votes. This is unfair because the winner-take-all system is based on the idea that the winner of the popular vote should get all of the electoral votes in that state. This is unfair because it is a violation of the principle of one person, one vote. The Electoral College is a failure because of the winner-take-all system.\n\nSecondly, the outdated and irrational nature of the Electoral College is detrimental to the country. For instance, the Electoral College is irrational because the Founding Fathers created it to help slaves, but now it is used to hurt them. The Electoral College is outdated because it was designed to represent the states, but now it represents the people. The Electoral College is irrational because it was designed to protect the states, but now it protects the people. The Electoral College is a failure because of its irrational nature.\n\nFurthermore, the potential for ties to be handled unprofessionally is dangerous. For instance, in the 1960 election, John F.

    "Scientific explanation behind the Face on Mars:\nThe Face on Mars is a geological feature on the Cydonia region of Mars which resembles a human face at a scale of 1:600. It is more than 20 miles long and is approximately 1 mile high.\n\nThe Face on Mars is believed to have been created by a geological process known as erosion. The Face on Mars is a part of a large plateau. The plateau is made up of volcanic basaltic lavas that covered the area 3 billion years ago. The plateau is almost 3 miles above the surrounding landscape. The plateau is surrounded by a large crater which is approximately 200 miles in diameter and was formed 3.5 billion years ago. The plateau is made up of a lava known as a basalt. Basalt is a very hard and durable rock that is formed when lava cools rapidly. Basalt is formed when lava cools down very quickly. The lava cools down rapidly for two reasons. The first reason is that the lava forms a very thin crust on the surface. The second reason is that the lava flows over a very short distance.

    "In today's society, technology has become an essential part of our daily life. It has also become an important part of education in the classroom. In the future, technology will eventually be used to allow teachers to read students' emotions and expressions in a classroom setting. This technology would be valuable for education systems, because it would allow teachers to be better educated about their students, and how they are learning, so that they can adapt to the students' needs.\n\nFirst and foremost, the main advantage of this technology would be that teachers would be able to better understand the students' emotions and expressions. For example, if a teacher were to be using this technology, and a student were to be in a bad mood, the teacher would know this and would be able to properly assist the student. This would also allow the teacher to better understand the students' learning curve, and how they are learning. For example, if a student were to be reading, and were to be on the same page as everyone else, yet were not comprehending the information, the teacher would be able to know this, and help the student understand the information.\n\nSecondly, this technology would also be beneficial to the students themselves. For example, if a student were to be having a difficult time with the material, and the teacher were to see this, the student would be able to receive help sooner. Also, if a student were to be having difficulty comprehending the material, and the teacher were to see this, the student would be able to receive help sooner. This would also allow for the teacher to understand the student's learning curve, and how they are learning. For example, if a student were to be reading, and were to be on the same page as everyone else, yet were not comprehending the information",

    "Summer is a time for relaxation and vacation, but it also has the potential to be an educational time for children. Whether they are spending their summer doing teacher-designed projects or student-designed projects, they can be learning and experiencing education. However, teacher-designed projects versus student-designed projects seem to have different levels of effectiveness. Teacher-designed projects seem to have more advantages over student-designed projects.\n\nWhen teachers design their own summer projects, they can make sure the projects are educational, age-appropriate, and challenging. For example, a teacher could design a summer project for her students that would teach them about the environment and the importance of recycling. The project could include having the students interview their parents about their recycling habits, and then create a survey to ask their friends about their recycling habits. They could then use the information they collected to create a presentation to educate their community about recycling. The students would learn about the environment and the importance of recycling, and they would also have the opportunity to practice their presentation skills.\n\nIn contrast, when students design their own summer projects, they have the freedom to create projects that interest them and are fun for them. For example, a student could design a summer project to learn about the history of her hometown. She could go online or to the library to learn about the history, and then she could make a time capsule to share the history with future generations. The student would learn about the history of her hometown, and she would also have the opportunity to practice her research skills.\n\nTeacher-designed projects seem to have more advantages over student-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects are educational and challenging, and they allow teachers to ensure that their students are learning and experiencing education. On the other hand, student-designed projects are fun, and they allow students to have the freedom to choose their own projects. In the end, the effectiveness of teacher-designed projects seems to be higher than the effectiveness of student-designed projects.\n\nPlease note that I am not a native English speaker. I am aware that the language is not perfect, and I would appreciate any corrections you could provide. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

    "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a method for identifying and analyzing facial expressions. The system was developed in the 1970s by Paul Ekman, a social psychologist who is now a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco. The system has since been used in various fields, including the study of human communication, the study of facial expressions in animals, and the study of facial expressions in children with autism. However, the system has not yet been used in a classroom setting. This research proposal will examine how the FACS can be used to improve student engagement and interest in classroom lessons.\n\nThe FACS uses a system of numbers and letters to identify specific facial movements. For example, the letter \u201cA\u201d represents an eyebrow raise, while the letter \u201cB\u201d represents an eyebrow raise with a smile. Different letters and numbers are assigned to different movements, which are then categorized into facial expressions. Facial expressions are categorized into six basic categories: happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust, and anger. Each of these six basic categories can be further subdivided into sub-categories, which can be used to identify more specific facial movements.\n\nThe FACS can be used to identify the facial expressions of students in a classroom setting. This will allow teachers to see which expressions are most commonly used by students, and which expressions are least commonly used. This information can then be used to improve student engagement in lessons. For example, if a teacher notices that a certain facial expression is used more frequently by students, he or she can use that information to design lessons that encourage that specific facial expression. In this way, the FACS can be used to improve student engagement in classroom lessons.\n\nThe FACS can also be used to improve student interest in classroom lessons. If a teacher notices that a certain facial expression is used more frequently by students, he or she can use that information to design lessons that encourage that specific facial expression. In this way, the FACS can be used to improve student interest in classroom lessons.\n\nThe FACS can be used to improve student engagement in classroom lessons.

    "When I was 14, I was a Seagoing Cowboy. I had gone to a school that specialised in helping troubled kids, and while I was there, I was told that I could go on a trip to Europe. I was really excited, as I had never been overseas before, and the thought of flying to England and then taking a ship across the ocean was really exciting. I got to walk along the beaches of Normandy, where the D-day landings took place, and I got to see the memorial that was built there. I also got to see the Eiffel tower, and I got to see all the sights in London. It was an amazing experience, and I really enjoyed it. The most interesting thing about the trip was the fact that we got to help people while we were there. We got to help the people who were wounded in WWII, and we got to help the people who were suffering from famine.

    "Extracurricular activities are important for every student as they teach us many things that school doesn\u2019t. They are not only about fun, but they are also about learning and gaining experience. Participation in such activities not only helps us to gain knowledge but also helps us in our college admissions. They also serve as a positive outlet for individuals dealing with personal struggles. I will support my argument with personal experiences and examples.\n\nFirstly, extracurricular activities help us to gain knowledge. For example, when I was in school, I joined the school band. I learnt how to play different musical instruments. I learnt how to play the guitar, the drums, the piano, and the flute. Not only did I gain knowledge about the music, but I also learnt how to be in a team. I learnt how to work with other people. I learnt how to face my fears and how to face failure. I also learnt how to take criticism. I learnt how to be responsible for my actions. All of these are life skills that are important for every individual. And they are all taught to me through participation in extracurricular activities. This is how they help us gain knowledge.\n\nSecondly, extracurricular activities help us in our college admissions.
