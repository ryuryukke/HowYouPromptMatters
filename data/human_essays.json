    "The Electoral College is a system of electing our president created by our founding fathers when they were writing the Constitution.\u00a0 Lately though, people have opposed the Electoral College due to the election when Al Gore beat George Bush in the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote(and a seat as President I do not support the Electoral College the lack of a direct link from the public to the election of the president the unfairness of it towards voters.\n I do not support the Electoral College because of a lack of a direct link from the public to the election of the president. Instead of the public voting for the president, they are voting for a group of electors who, in turn, elect the president.\u00a0 The problem with that is that the group of electors can be anyone not holding the public office.\u00a0 But just in case of dishonest electors, states hold state conventions to pick the electors.\u00a0 But even after this, voters still can not control who their state's electors vote for.\u00a0 Sometimes, electors get confused about who someone voted for and put them down for a candidate different from whom they originally voted for.\u00a0 Now we could avoid all this trouble if we just did away with Electoral College and had a direct vote for president, and have the election \"by the people and for the people\" instead of \"by the people and for the electors. I do not support the Electoral College because of the unfairness of it towards the voters Due to the winner take all system in each state, candidates for president don't focus on winning every state.\u00a0 Instead, they focus on only winning the \"swing\" states, or, states whose political party support is constantly changing.\u00a0 In the presidential election of 2000, the presidential candidates didn't see 17 states(including, but not limited to, Rhode Island and South Carolina) and 25 of the largest media markets' voters didn't see a single presidential campaign ad.\u00a0 This is another good reason to get rid of the Electoral College Based on this evidence, I believe the Elelectoral College should be done away with because of a lack of a direct link to the election of the president and the unfairness of it towards voters.\u00a0 ",
    "This goes out to the senator of florida. I think we need to chang to voteing way. We need to change it from the Electoral college to the most popular vote for the president of th Unitd States of America. Because whats the point of all of our parents and alot of other adults of voting if we can't even get what we want but no it's all up to the electors and congress, ect. like for real what is the point in voting if it isn't a fair shot. Now that I've read it we don't even vote for the prsident we vote for the slate of electorswho in turn elect the president. Whom are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depnds on the state sometimes state conventions sometimes the stateparty's centeral committee sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for ? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate? Sometimes. At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. And dont likethat because the what the heck is happening if were not acktually voting for the president and just the electors. Like for real then whats the point of voting if were not getting what we want. When the goverment is all about giveing the people what they want. ",
    "This policy change will be a bad idea because a c average is good. B average is better but many school will not have a lot of kids playing sport.\n a c average is not the best but it will get you in to high school. a lot of kids my even move from to school and go to a school that c averages can play sports. its not going to be fair to a lot of kids not saying it will be better in a way it may be a good idea if the school is doing bad like kid are getting d and F 's. it may improve kids in there work so they will get a and B 's it will be for the best. i been to a school that the kids talk back to the teacher and the throw stuff at the teacher and the school say if you have a c average you are off sports. the kids got way better a lot of the bad kids transferred to a new school and the good kids stayed so they swiched back to c average. i when to a good school last time it was the best you can get in with a d average. than the school got bad cause the kid from a different school came and they did so bad that they swiched it to a A average to play sport. the kids did not care so they just got rid of to sports i think a c average is the best for the school so everything can be equal. a,b,c,d,f. c is in the middle a B has 3 in back and one in front it will be the biggest mistake to do this. that is my reson",
    "The popularity of mobile devices has had some unintended and sometimes deadly consequences. An alarming number of traffic accidents are linked to driving while distracted, including use of mobile devices while driving, resulting in injury and loss of life. The most recent national statistics are sobering. 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving in 2017 alone, 8.5 percent of total fatalities for the year.\nApproximately nine people are killed and more than 1,000 injured daily in the United States in incidents reported as involving a distracted driver. During daylight hours across America, approximately 481,000 drivers are using cell phones while driving. Teens were the largest age group reported as distracted at the time of fatal crashes . Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. While texting while driving certainly doesn't always lead to a fatality, there are a wealth of statistics that show that texting and driving is directly connected to traffic deaths National Safety Council reports that cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes on a yearly basis while texting while driving is six times more likely to cause a crash than drunk driving is. One out of every four traffic crashes that occur in the U.S. are spurred by cell phone usage, and furthermore, each day, 11 teens die as a result of texting and driving, which is a downright astounding number. Over 3,000 teens and young drivers die yearly due to texting while driving. Almost every state has laws strictly prohibiting texting while driving, and those who don't often consider it a distracted driving offense. States that once allowed texting while driving have since cracked down on distracted driving. Many states also prohibit talking on the phone while driving unless you are using a hands-free device. If you are a commercial driver, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) prohibits all commercial drivers from using hand-held mobile devices.\n Distracted driving consists of driving while distracted in any manner. While cell phone use is often a part of it, distracted driving also encompasses many other activities, including eating, reading, drinking, talking to other passengers, looking around, adjusting location devices, adjusting the radio or any other activity that takes the driver's attention away from the task of driving. While any of these activities may be involved, texting while driving is usually considered the most serious type of distracted driving because it causes the most types of distraction. ",
    "Over the past 4 decades cell phones have evolved extremely.\nNowadays people use their phones for just about any and everything. Things such as texting, calling, playing games, booking appointments, even checking latest posts on social media and much more. Cell phones started to become a problem when people were just looking down at their phones while crossing the street. Something that could be fixed. Now, people are choosing to use their phones while driving which has become an issue and is very dangerous. Which puts not only the driver in danger put others as well.\n Each day people are dying or being injured from using their cellular devices while being behind the wheel. Each year 421,000 people in the United States are injured due to a driver being distracted by their device. It's more common for teens and young adults to text and drive (ages 18-24). 14% of fatal crashes are involved from texting and driving in this age division. In 2017 the \"Hands Free Law\" had been issued. Which means drivers are allowed to use hand free devices only while being behind the wheel of a car and being completely free of a device. Although people may think the hands free law has prevented less accident it hasn't it only makes people have the urge to reach for their devices even more. 11 teenagers die every day due to texting and driving. Teenagers are 400% more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving. AT&T's Teen Driver Survey found that 97% of teenagers think it's dangerous, while 43% of them engage in the activity anyway.\n In conclusion I strongly disagree with texting and driving because it puts more than one person in danger. I feel as if you need to use your device while behind the wheel of a moving vehicle be mindful and pull to the side. Weather it's for making a quick call or sending a quick message even typing in a location into the GPS pull over because anything could happen in the blink of an eye. ",
    "yes there should because our school is not clean and a lot of students leave there trash and they blame other people. For some other people trash . That's not right that they do that so defenetly . We shold have community service for those student that don't clean up there own mess. I think that is a great idea cause when u put that rule they would start to listen to the school rules. Then they would all see how we need to listen to the school that when they say to clean up is time to clean every body should listen to every thing the principal wants every body to listen to him to what he says to students and also listen to your teachers because that is not fare you don't do the right things. I think the students would listen to him he is a nice principal. ",
    "People tend to ask more than one person at a time for advice because it can make them seem comfortable with their answer, but also there are so many different ways people do this and there can also be a lot of ways why people would do this One example that I can think about is when your trying to spelling a word in class. You might be thinking that you have spelled that one word wrong and want it to be confirmed that you're either right or wrong. The first thing you'll probably ask is your friend next to you, but you think that they spelled your word wrong too. You might ask another friend, yet that other friend still gets it wrong. After that I'm guessing your going to go ask your teacher that has more knowledge on spelling. You do this because you want to comfirm that you were right and didn't trust yourself There are so many different times where you need someone elses opinion on a daily bases someone might ask if they like him or hers outift today or ask if you liked what they cooked for dinner. They do this because they need clarrifiction with you or need someone elses opinion to make them feel comortable if they are questioning something about themselfs. Some people may act independent but I'm sertain that they have asked for an opinion even if it's just something small I mean that you probably ask for someones opionion at least five times a day or if not more, usally we don't even think before saying it. When we ask for an imput on what or how another person thinks I think is also a way to fit in. Just like following a trend we ask to stay updaited and so we make a normal decision. Even just the way everyone thinks and acts differently is actually a big reason to why we ask for another persons opinion. This is because if that one person has more knowledge on that one thing, there will be some people that will ask for there opinion on it so they can have some more understanding about whatever it is that that person knows.\nFor example if someone is trying to learn how to skateboard (meaning they just started and aren't comfortable riding yet) and are trying to learn a new trick, they will probably practice a lot but if they are at the skate park with a friend they're going to ask there friend for some pointers on learning that new trick. Yet if you went with two of your friends one being really good at skateboarding and knowing all the tricks and the other doesn't even own a skateboard. You would want to ask the one who knows how to skate but would probably end up asking both of your friends just for the sake of knowing more and go with the opinion with the friend you think helps the most. People giving out their opinion to someone who needs it is a person who is always willing to help. When asking someone for their opinion they might not always give it to you which might be another reasons to why you have to ask other people. The main reason they probably won't give their opinion to you is because they are also unsure and don't want to give out the wrong imformation. Somebody else that doesn't know a lot about what your asking might just guess because they don't really know too much on what your asking and at the end say \"but I don't know for sure\" which puts the person asking the question in an awkard situtaion and that's when they will ask somebody else. I think the most popular reason why people ask more than one person is that they are unsure with ones opinion and need to confirm with different people so they can make sure that they are final with their decision These people probably will do this when it's important like when your doing a school project. Yet they might do this because the first person they ask he or she might think they asked the wrong person because their answer was totally different from what they first got. I think that asking different people for their opinion is good so you can have more understanding and more clarrifiction to know what another persons imput is.\u00a0",
    "As you know every four years a president is elected. In order for that to happen the candidates go through the process of an Electoral College or the people vote. An Electoral College is when the congress gets to vote to pick who the president and vice president will be. And the other way is when the people of that state get to vote. some disavantages of doing an Electoral College is if the president is bad the congress will get blammed. Vandalism, riots, breaking laws. Who knows how far people will go to get their way. And there are many more mistakes that happen. As said in the article the voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Now there are some disavantages for the people voting but not as many and not as bad. Yes people can still get angery and do bad things, but due to the privacy when we vote there is no one to speicficly blame. There are way more of us then the congress, so mistakes won't always affect things as bad. even though there are many many disavantages and mistakes about the Electoral College there are a few advantages. Like it takes less time for the congress to vote. But to be honest why rush to fail. by letting the people vote it gives everybody a fair chance to say their oppinion and it has so much less conflict. I admit the congress does know alot but the decesion on the president is going to mostly affect us, the people.\n Everybody has the right to have their own oppinion. In my oppinion I think the people should vote. there are very few things we can do to change things. The congress has power over so much and it it feels like the most people can do is say what we think, even when we know it can't change anything. We the people don't have the power to change much but by letting the people vote it can make a big differnce. the United States is a great place and no one wants to see it go down hill from one wrong mistake. And the solution is very simple, let the people vote. The people's oppinion are very important and need to be heard!",
    "Every summer break, students are given projects in certain classes to make sure they continue to improve over the break.\nThese projects handed out to the students are always made by the teachers, but what if we change that? Students should one hundred percent be the ones who plan out and create their own summer projects. they know exactly what they need to improve on to be ready for the following year. Students know what they struggled with and what they were good at during the school year.\nTeachers can not always grasp what a student may need in order to keep improving. In order for students to recieve any sort of benefit from the summer project, is if they make it themselves.\nIf I was able to make my own summer project with my classmate I would know what needed to be included in order for me to succeed. teachers tend to make assignments very long, hard, time consuming, and usually very boring. Teachers can overstep because it may not seem like a lot of work to them, but to the students, it is.\nThey can put in too much information which can make it less benificial to the students. Doing a project over summer break that is not productive, is a huge waste of time. Students might be more willing and excited to do their summer projects if they create it themselves because it will be something they all enjoy doing. \n Most people I know, including me dont start even looking at the projects that the teachers give to us until the night before schools starts, but if we as students create our own we already know what we have to accomplish.\nDue to the amount of excitment for their projects, there will be a large increase in the number of students who complete the task and get a good grade, which starts the school year off on a good note.\nI always tend to work best and work harder on the subjects and or topics I enjoy the most.\nI would also complete my work in full if it was intresting to me. \n Students deserve a long, stressless summer, but with the teacher's stressful assignments, that might not always happen for them.\nAll students deserve a say in what they do with their time over their own break.\nIt is fair to them and the teachers.\nThe summer break projects created by the students will be more productive, less time consuming and more fun for everyone.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ",
    "The reason people make mistakes,the reason why they have mostly opinions,and the reason why there is some bias Some good reasons for people to ask multiple and not one person to see what there point of view looks like and to take out some opinions One example for this is if your friend says something like chuck y\u00a0cheese is the worst, that would be an opinion and it would make a bad article, but on the other hand if your friend would have said reasons why chuck y cheese is the worst than that would back up your statement, by saying something like,One reason chuck y cheese is bad is because of the health conditions and list examples to back up the statement that was made. people have different mindsets than others, Which also leads to people thinking differently. What I mean is something like,some people have better writing and talking abilities than others. For example you ask someone why a certain topic like stretching before running is good someone might say,\n\"Because it's easier to run\", and someone else might say\n\"One reason you should stretch before running is because if you stretch, your muscles will be loosened and more relaxed and there would be less of a risk of getting a cramp\". the second person actually used facts about what will happen and the first person only said one thing that was not specific.\n if you dont ask more than one person you won't be able to add even more facts like if someone said, a fact you really liked and you dident ask anyone else and you make an article about it you wont be able to write as much on the article if there is only one thing you can write about. Which could also lead to the article looking way to short and the public wont want to buy it because of the little amount of work that was put into it. if you ask more than one person it could probably change your point of view or your opinion about the topic. like if you said sharks are cute someone else could say, they might be but some things about the shark are that they have a really large mouths,really sharp teeth and some more stuff which might either lead the person to think about why before he thought sharks were cute and now say they are really dangerous or just keep saying the sharks are cute because you have not been anywhere near them yet.\u00a0because some people know more things than others because of what they might have learned in the past that you havent learned yet. or just things that have to do with religion and where you where born.\n if you dont know the person very well you might not know how smart the person is or if they are lieing to you, if you go to more than one person and they basically all say around the same exact thing, Than whatever the first person said you will know that they were correct about what they said and after you ask the people go on the internet and search about the topic and if there are any words that sound familiar than you will know that you are 100 percent correct. if your not quite sure on how to like publish a book and you ask more than one person you might learn something new and then if someone ask you how to do it you wont just say I dont know anymore you will be saying I\u00a0absolutely know how to do it which could als help people find or look for jobs. and something else is that if your doing something that is illegal\u00a0and have friends that dont do it and you want to stop but dont know how to you can maybe ask more than one friend on how to stop which could help you later on becaus you would have multiple ways to stop whatever your doing,\n Instead of only one way that maybe you think is really risky and have to take a chance. Which could really help someone out with their life because you ask somone how to deal with it and you dont like the idea then you can to to your other friend and ask him.",
    "I believe that when the people of the United States vote for the president it be should be deicided by the popular vote adn not the Electoral College. First, I think the president should be chosen by the popular vote because then all the poeple in that state will have a say not just someone else chosing for them Most people usually chose for themselves because they have the right. Everybody should have a say not just\n\"the qualified citizens\"\nwriten in source one. Secondly, yes people make bad and somtimes terribles mistakes but thats what we do. The Electoral College has flaws just like anyone or anything else. Like in source two\n\"the single best argument agaisnt the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.\"\neven they make mistakes sometimes. So yes the electoral college might be useful but it can also be very jugdemental. don't you think you have the choice to choose who leads this country? Maybe you don't but some do.\u00a0 ",
    "A common phrase teachers enjoy using is \"Ask three before me\". This phrase is the same way with receiving advice. Asking others before the final decision is an important choice to make. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, there are more options when asking for opinions, advice will be different from one person to another, learning plays a big role for making better choices. For example; more people, more choices. If there is a situation of being unsure of what option to take, there are many peers to go to for advice, opening more options.\nas well as more options, there is also no absolute wrong or right answer. People automatically believe that there is only one right choice to make, but in most cases that is not true because of the many paths people can choose to go along. Seeing others' views can also help when making better choices. When asking for advice, others will most likely have a different picture in mind than others. The type of advice will be different depending on the person. Going to the right peer for advice is extremely important, rather than going to a bunch of random people for opinions. Another important factor of advice is that it is for consideration. Advice is not a requirement. At the end of the day, it is still the persons decision to make, whether or not they'll make the right choice or not. Most importantly, advice can help in daily lives. using others advice will not only help in the moment, but also in the future. Hearing what others have to say is important for learning good choices. Sometimes, it is hard to learn from the past without someones advice or opinion. as well as that, people are most definitely capable of learning from their previous mistakes. After receiving opinions and thoughts from others, people can learn what they did differently in the past, and correct it. the last big part of the learning section is that we can take others' opinions and learn a life lesson from them. having other opinions is important when realizing past mistakes. In the end, learning will always be a big role in making a better choice. seeking multiple opinions will help people make better choices. There are more options to choose from, advice to take, and lessons to learn from. In the future, we should always ask others for their opinion on the choices we make, depending on the situation. receiving advice is extremely important for making better choices than before. We can learn from our mistakes from the past by hearing what others have to say. We should always speak to more than one person for advice. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
    "I believe students shouldn't have to do community service if they don't want to. It shouldn't be a priority for students to help. It should be a decided thing whether the student wants to or not. Kids all want to have fun and most students don't want to spend their time doing community service. So why make them? Let kids have fun, let kids decide whether or not they want to do community service. Its the right thing to do. Making it a priority for students to do community service can mess up students education. If the principle made students have a class for community service could you imagine the lack of education the kids can be getting. What about the lack of physical education? What if doing community service took up physical education classes?, How do you think your students would feel? Them not being able to run around and hang out will make them furious if id didn't have physical education I'd be angry too! Yes, i know community service is something to better build your character, but do teenagers really need community service? Sooner or later teenagers will figure out how to become better people. Its all part of growing up. Let your students grow up. So do you rather, making it a priority for your students to do community service or not? Do you rather them miss out on part of their education just to clean a field or to read to little children? Isn't that why we have teachers? Or do you want your students to be mad at their principle because there's not time to hang out or get all their energy out? Take it from me a student myself, you should let students have time to hang out its the best thing for kids our age. Making kids do community service may take that time up. Don't make it a priority for community service! Community service is not that big a deal! ",
    "When you make a decision, you want to make the most people happy possible. So why would you only ask one person? You should ask a lot of people it can help you make the best choice possible, It can help better the chances of making more people happy, it gives you a better source of knowledge When making a decision, you want to make the best choice. That is what anyone making a decision would try to do. But it is hard to make the best choice when only choosing one person to talk to. If you talk to one person, then you only make the choice on what one person wants, and everyone else that the choice is affecting may not like the decision that was made. So when making a decision ask more than one person, in fact ask a lot of people so you can make a decision that the majority or even all of the people involved will like. When you talk to just one or two people, they cant give you an accurate result of what other people are going to want, everyone else doesnt want just one or two people deciding their fate. They would feel more safe with the decision if everyone was asked so the decider could find the best thing to do, and make the right decision for everyone. One person should not be in control in the outcome of the choice. Which is another reason why asking more people what to do is a good choice. Your source is so more reliable when you ask a lot of people. When you ask one person they are deciding what is best for themselves, rather than what is best for more people. But when you ask a large ammount of people, they can help you decide what is the best choice for everyone, and not just for one person. That makes the group of people a very reliable source to base your decision off of. The most reliable source of knowledge, making the most people happy, and making the best overall decision. These are three reasons why asking a lot of people for their opinions is better than using one person. So why would someone just ask one person for their opinion? I have no idea, but I do know that asking more people is the best option for everyone. If you are faced with a hard decision now or in the future, just remember that it is always better to ask for a lot of peoples opinions on the choice, rather than just one or two people.",
    "Summer projects should be teacher designed and not student designed. When designing a project over the summer, a teacher's design will be more structured,\u00a0with a clear goal for the overall project.\u00a0 with teacher's knowing what skills and materiel students need to learn, they will be able to design a proper and well throughout project that will keep the students on their feet. when it comes to summer, the last thing on a students mind is school based learning. So, lots of students will either procrastinate or create a poorly designed project leading to no continuation of learning over the break A teacher is someone who has learned the ins and outs of school based learning,\u00a0who went to college and received a teaching degree, and has a specialized learning in usually one or more subjects. Summer for students resembles a break from school. Whether that means traveling to the Bahamas or staying home, a student does not want even the slightest thought of school in their mind. Some might say that student-designed projects allow a more personalized\u00a0and creative component. Additionally, students will be able to design a project they enjoy learning. This is true, but not just for student designed projects. Like students, teachers can design different types or styles of projects allowing all types of learning for the student. For example, a teacher can design a project for mechanical engineering, biology, political sciences, Algebra 2, or more, allowing multiple choices for the student to choose. Also no matter what project design a student receives, the topics will be broad, giving space for creative thinking. The teacher-designed projects won't just give students space for creative opportunities but also flexibility\u00a0with their\u00a0decision. When it comes to summer projects, teachers should be the ones designing them. They are specialist in learning and know what further steps students need to take to learn. With the teachers clear design instructions and guidance, it will make summer learning much easier and efficient. Teacher designed projects aren't just helpful for students but teachers as well. When grading or examining the projects, that they designed, it will be easier for them to grade and compare to other students. So when in comes to whether summer projects should be either student-designed or teacher designed, teacher-designed is the way to go and will assure a continuation of learning during the summer break.

    "My position is that self-driving cars should be manufactured and eventually should be sold to the general public. The cars wouldn't fix all of the problems that come along with cas accidents and problems but it can help reduce them. The reason why self-driving cars should be manufactured is because it can stop ,or help prevent less accidents from happening. If theres less people in the car, then there are less people to get hurt ,and if the car is driving it going to be safe to have the car drive its self because its programed to make the best decision to keep the passenger others safe. BMW is making a car with a in-car safety feature to reduce the use of cellphones being used while behind the wheel. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have all allowed limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Companies and people wouldn't want to make or buy the cars if they weren't proven to be as safe as possible. It also said in paragraph 5, that they have cars that auto lock the breaks to make it safer. Self driving cars could also reduce the percentage of DUI related car accidents, and deaths by having the car drive for you instead of anyone risking getting put in jail or getting pulled over. Paragraph 4 also says that the cars will have a lot of sensors on them to detect any obstacles and for the car to be aware of its surroundings at all times.\n In conclusion I think that self-driving cars should be made because they can help better the world and the future ahead by reducing the percentage of accidents, and problems that human drivers put themselves at risk to.",

Next, the scientist does not have proof that it could be any signs of aliens surviving on Mars. In paragraph 7 it say that thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site , reavealing a natural landform. Also in paragraph 3 it pronounced that the face was a huge rock formation. Which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes , noes, and mouth (3). Finally, The face on mars just was a thing to benefit NASA. It states in paragraph 3 in the end that it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. This face became into something huge. It has become a pop icon, starred in a Hollywood film, apperead in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and grocery lines. This face on mars was just put into the public to have attention drawn to NASA. In conclusion, their were no aliens on Mars planting faces because, the face on Mars was just a benefit to Nasa, there was not any proof or sign of aliens on Mars, and it looked equivalent to a butte or mesa. Most people know that their were not any aliens on Mars because their was not any proof. One day researchers might find traces of aliens! ",
    "What kinds of things happen at your house? Is it loud or quiet? Is there a lot of people at home or almost no one? Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. While this may be helpful to some students at specific times, it is not beneficial for them. Students are children who are still in the process of learning and are still adapting to the world around them. Distance learning is not beneficial for students they can be easily distracted at home, they could have electronic complications, they could develop little to no social skills. Distance learning is not helpful towards students because they can be easily distracted at home. Within a person's personal area, people have a tendency to relax and forget about the things that need to be done. Personally, I have forgotten about many assignments that were due the next day simply because I was relaxing in my room. I was aware that I needed to do my homework, but I had thought that I could watch YouTube for a few minutes and still be able to complete my work. After I watched one video, I saw another that I was interested in, and soon I had forgotten about my assignments that were due the next day. I forgot about my work because I wasn't in a suitable environment for me to focus on my work. Another example to show how easily distracted students are at home would be their family. While I was trying to work on an essay for English, my sister was being rowdy and playful. She had came into my room for a split second and ran back out leaving my door open in that same moment. This allowed for the sound of my mother's T.V. to come into my room and I wasn't able to concentrate on the topic of my essay any longer. Families are distracting when you are trying to work on things like homework, essays, and projects. A home is not quiet enough for you to focus and there are too many distractions that your family can cause. Seeing as distance learning is through online or video conferencing, students may have electronic complications. Computers can do various things but they aren't without faults. My friend, Generic_Name, had tried to do an assignment that needed to be done online but the weather wasn't exactly favorable for her. The rain had caused some neighborhoods to lose electricity and Generic_Name's neighborhood was one of them. She wasn't able to finish her assignment on time and had gotten a lower grade than she would have liked. Technology can't be relied upon to do work when the weather can destroy your efforts and make it seem like you didn't try at all. There are also malfunctions that could happen to the technology that the student is working on. My friend, Generic_Name, had tried to type up his summer reading project when his computer had suddenly shutdown. Generic_Name soon discovered that his laptop had a virus and he needed to get a new one. As he was setting up his new laptop, he had tried going back to his project but it hadn't saved his progress so he had to start from scratch all over again. Electronics can have faults at times like getting viruses or there might not be any service where the student is at. This leads things to be difficult and the situation can get worse over time. The internet isn't safe and technology isn't always the best option to use to work on things. Students could develop little to no social skills if they were to take distance learning. Distance learning is an education gained through a computer rather than being lectured and helped in person. Learning through a computer doesn't give you the necessary social skills you need to go through life. When I'm in class with a teacher, I'm able to ask that teacher questions. While you can also do that online, the interactions are completely different. You are behind a screen with possibly no one around you. Getting an education this way will damage your social skills unless you are socializing with people outside of your home and neighborhood. Online learning doesn't allow you to interact with your classmates or your teacher. You need to be able to talk properly to people you don't know because once you graduate you have to speak to the people around you to understand current situations or to get a job. Every job includes some interaction with a person face-to-face, and if your social skills aren't good then you will struggle until they get better. I'm a shy person but being able to interact with people in person has improved my social skills. You don't have to talk to someone for long periods of time, but don't stay behind a computer screen. Go out in the world and talk to someone you haven't before; you may even become close friends in the future. The people you interact with are going to be important to you in some way, positive or negative, and without them you are going to be lost in life. Distance learning is good for when a student is sick or out of town, but it isn't good as an option to fully learn online. There are many issues that can happen like you won't get the grade you are working for or you broke your computer so now you can't learn until you replace your old one. In order to get by in life, you need to be able to talk to people in person and be able to understand what you are doing. Are you going to get by in life by being behind a screen? Are you going to travel around and explore new places and talk to new people? What are your plans for the future?",
    "What would the world be like if we could just type in your wanted destination and just go withoug needing a driver, how would the world react for such a thing?\nCould the car just think on it's own? How would everything even work on the car? In my opinion, we shouldn't have driverless cars untill we can get them to be fully driverless without taking away so many taxi jobs, wrecks, and confusion during them wrecks.\n I don't think that we should have driverless cars, because taxi companies would loose all their emploies, it would save the company money but, also what about that families? How are they going to get their next meal on the table without a job? Driverless cares would leave people hungry and jobless, then their kids would be taken by DCS and them the ' family ' would be seperated. Meaning driverless cars are bad for the people because it can cause poverty among the people. Also, driverless cars could cause many wrecks by not having exact measurment of when to stop And much of the driving laws include a person to be driving. How would the car get it's licentce ? Would it have a liceence? When driving you use your brain a car doesnt have a brain aso it wouldn't work out for them. In other words, you need a person , a driver, still to have a driverless car ; so would it really be considered a driverless car? No.\n Then, theres the part when they do get into a wreck, who's fault would it be because there isn't a driver to blame? who do they sue? how wouold insurence be on a driverless care? The company who manerfaactured the car would be the one to blame because they should have prepared for the situation, also they would be the ones the be sued. It's just a bad idea all together because the company will go bankruped.\n So, think again, how would the world be if there was a such thing as driverless cars? would it be good or would it be bad? we already know that its gonna be a bad idea so why am i even asking you ? It's bad because iit takes jobs from hardworking drivers, causes wreacks, and confustion. So, driverless cars for all is a NO GO.",
    "In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author gives us reasons why exploring Venus would be very difficult. But, at the same time, the author gives us reasons why it's important to explore Venus. It's because Venus is Earth like, and so we might be able to visit it one day. The article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" states, \"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally rhe losest in distance too\" This is very important, it means that because that Venus is Earth like, as well as the closest planet to earth at times, its important to learn about it, in case we need to go to it at anytime. \n At the end, the artivle also states, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meed the very edges on imagination and innovation.\" This means that even though it's dangerouse to go to Venus, we shouldn't help us hold it back, space is a very dangerous place, and if we let us hold us back, we won't get anywhere, and Fast.

    "There are alot of rumors going around about \"Unmasking the face on Mars.\" Many say that it is a face that was created by the aliens in Mars. However, this is not true. Scientists in NASA have background information that states that it is a Martian mesa. The rumor of \" Unmasking the Face on Mars\" is false because scientists have background research proving it isn't, authors influenced readers to think that it was, the scientists used higher quality cameras. Scientist have done so much background research on this topic of the \"face\" to prove that their statement is true. The scientists statement was that it was another Martian mesa. Martian mesa's are very common in the Cydonia area. Only that this one had unusual shadows that made it look like a face. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Only to reveal that they were correct, it was just a natural landform. What the picture actually showed was butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West. Authors influenced many readers to think that it was a face so they could engage them. When NASA unvieled the image for the public to see the caption quoted, \" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and a mouth.\" Many authors thought this would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. To their suprise it did catch many readers attention. The \" Face on Mars\" starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows. and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. People thought the face was a bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would prefer to hide. However, defenders on the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. Scientists took several pictures to prove their point. Another thing scientists did was take several pictures to see different points of views and from different angles. The first picture taken of the \"face\" was on the\nNASA Viking 1. The second picture taken was on the Mars orbiter Camera which snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. These pictures clearly proved that it was a natural land formation, a mesa, which were very common in that area. The rumor of \" Unmasking the Face on Mars\" is false because scientists have background research proving it isn't, authors influenced readers, and the scientists used higher quality cameras. These are the reasons how the \"face\" on Mars was never true.",
    "First of all,Driverless cars are a great idea to have in the future because it helps prevent alot of accidents and would be cool to have. I think they should do more stuff to the driverless car like add a entertainment center so the driver would be entertained and more people would probably be interested in buying one in the future. Driverless cars would be wonderful to have in the future because they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves without a human having to do anything and it would notify a human driver to take over when the situation requires.\nAlso, manufactures are considering to use cameras to watch the driver while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver so that the driver is not texting or doing other things while driving, which would prevent accidents or being pulled over and given a ticket. A negative thing about having a driverless car is that drivers would get bored when waiting for their turn to drive. But, some manufactures hope to bring in some car enterainment and information systems so that the driver would be entertained in having something to do when they\u00b4re not driving. Finally, driverless cars would be great to have in the future because it has all this new technology inside that would keep you safe and entertained when you\u00b4re not driving. Although, driverless cars has some negative things about it that would need work on but overall, I would reccomend it to people to buy in the future. Also, this specific car would help prevent alot of accidents and deaths from a regular car because a driverless car has a camera to watch what you\u00b4re doing so you are safe. ",
    "it gives differnt views, it helps puts heads together, the other person can give advice on a situation. 60% more men commite suicide than women do. Thats because men don't share their feelings or anything to anyone. Another person can look at it in a positive way while you look at it in a negetive way. Looking at it in a good way can make the situation so much better for you and anyone who is imvolved in it. if that other person can make you think positive that it can take so much stress off your body and so many other people around you. For example If your kid puts ramon noodles in the microwave wihout any water than it catches on fire but he diden't burn the house down then just focuse of the bright side. The house is still in great condition and its not burned down. More heads works better than just one head dealing with that situation. More people's options on it can make you think/ look at it in a whole diffen't stand point. You can ask for someone's option and you might treally not agree with you on it but they might have a really good reason and facts to prove their option. For example if one of your friends calls you about the math homework and you both don't know what to do then you can put your heads together and try to figure it out. Giving advice can go both ways in a heated situation between anything. You can give someone advice o how there doing in math like you saw their math test score and you give them advice on how to study. They cantake that so far and think you think they're dumb or stupid. Or you can give someone advice about their relashonship. If they have never been in a relashionship before tell them the basics or how to treat a girl right or just anything good that helps build a good relationship with their partner. For example if your best friend comes to you for advice on how to make a girl happy or atleast show her that you love her or atleast care about her than you need to tel him how to do that because it might be his first one or no girl has treated him right and he's scared to love someone again. Going to someone for mulitiple options can be bad or can be good. Giving someone advice,more options on a decion or more views on a decions can really help someone thats stressed out about it. Help smeone who comes to you for help it means a lot to them.",
    "I find this idea very smart, but yet unfair. A grade of a C is a average grade. People with a C average should be able to be on the team, but maybe just not play in the games. The students are on the team so they can be able to play in the games. So by not letting them play in the games, they will work hard to bring their average up. Maybe some type of motivation will help them like saying if you get your average up, you will get a week off homework . Instead of kicking them off the team, give them a little leeway. Just make them sit the bench a couple games and then they will learn to work harder. academics come before sports. The students will not have sports when it comes to real life. In order to get a job, you have to be well educated and ready. It doesn't matter how good of an athlete you are, sports won't be there all your life. if the student is trying his very best, you have to consider. The student may not be the brightest kid is the world, but if he is giving the best he can do, second think just kicking him off the team. Doing the best you can in everything is really all that matters. If you can do that, you are in good shape for everyday life.\n you have to think about what you are doing. I'm not saying that a C average is good, but don't be that hard. Make the student have some more time maybe before practice to get his work done and study a little bit. That will help a lot. Because more than likely, he does not have that much time when he gets home to do homework, depending on the practice time. ",
    "Limiting the amount of driving allowed and having car-free cities can have several benefits by reducing the amount of air pollution and traffic jams Some disadvantages of having car-free cities are time management and paying fines to drive. Greenhouse gasses can be reduced by limiting driving in cities and having car free cities. About 50 percent of greenhouse gasses are from passenger cars in some cities in the United States and 12 percent in Europe. There were about 80 micrograms of particulate per cubic meter in London and 114 in Brussels. Paris has the most air pollution with 147 micrograms per cubic meter.\n Paris has 67 percent of its vehicles run on diesel fuel, which is blamed for most of the air pollution. The rest of Western Europe has an average of 53.3 percent of vehcicles fueled by diesel. Car emissions are traped from the warm air caused by cold nights and warm days. A partial ban was created in Paris for driving to reducce the amount of pollution. Drivers with even number license plates could drive on certain days and odd number plates would drive on other days. After only five days the air pollution was down by 60 percent. In Bogota there are car free days and 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed and the amount of traffic jams during rush hour were down by almost half. Limiting driving will lower the amount of traffic and it made several people happier. Most public transportation was free on weekends. When driving was not allowed, people would be walking and riding bikes. Most people in car free cities enjoyed the sound of children instead of hearing the sound of motors all of the time. Public transportation was allowed every day and it reduced the amount of traffic with having fewer cars on the streets and roads.\n \nWhen driving on days then it's not allowed the drivers have to pay fines. In Paris drivers with even number license plates would drive on certain days andodd numbers drive on the other days. If someone is driving on the wrong day there is a fine of 22 euors or 31 dollars for each day that they drive when they can't. In bogota there is a 25 dollar fine for driving on car free days. Time management is another problem when someone can't drive their car. Going to work would take longer when walking, riding a bike or using the public transportation.\n \nhaving car free cities and limitin driving can be good for reducing the amount of air pollution and the amount of traffic out on the roads. Some people feel happier when they live in a car free city because they feel like they have less stress but some people dont like paying fines when they are driving their car on certain days. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ",
    "I would say that we keep the Electoral College because it has worked over the past century so why change it now. The people voting don't always know what they want in a president they might be undecided and just choose the best looking one I mean yeah some have their facts straight and know how the president they are voting is going to help the united states become a better country overall When people have to much freedom they don't know what to do and do wrong choices so i think choosing a elector is a good thing they have studied the president and have heard countless promises that he has done. I mean he or she most likley will vote for the candiate running for president you did because he or she is a elector he or she gets the people who also voted for the same person as he or she wants. I mean we people are still voting we still have the vote just that our vote goes to choosing a certain elector instead of just directly leaving it to the people to vote for a ceratin candiate running for president. By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that \"Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party.\" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where. This does make the candiate running for president try to convience the electors he is the one they need and that he will help our country be better. This also helps the candiate running for president know what states he should go to since some states they already know they lost It stated in the article that \"A solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win.\"So this keeps the president from having to go to every state because its just no based of popular vote and want every individual person votes for. I think the Electoral college is great and well organized the process is good and the only thing is does is make the voting process more easier and ordered. I think we should keep it i mean it has had his troubles her and there but it has worked so good for such a long time. We don't want to change it and create choas since a lot of people are not use to change and don't take it quite well",
    "So the other day I was working at NASA just like everyday and something was brought up that I had never heard before. What was brought up was that back in the 70's, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a top region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The person who said this out loud said it was just formations called butte or mesa's which are very common around the American West. What happened was pretty normal at NASA. One of my co workers blurted out it was probably created by aliens. More people started agreeing with him because how else could a human looking face get on a planet that nobody ever talked about. It started to have me thinking about space and all the crazy things that happen, so I decided to do some research when I got home. I looked around the internet, and went to the public library to look for some books about rock formatons on different planets. Once I got those, I finally began research and what I found was shocking I believe that the face on Mars is not and ancient alein artifact rock formations form on every planet pictures can be deceving there is no scientific proof that aliens have ever existed. I believe that the face found on Mars is not an ancient alien artifact because rock formations form on every planet. research has shown that the face found on Mars looksv like lanforms common around the American West. As far as people know, that face could have just gotten there from some sort of sand storm on the big red planet back in the 70's. Another thing that people shold know is that pictures can be deceving. I believe that the face found on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact because pictures can be deciving What scientist knew back then, and what they know now is a lot different. There is much more technological advances now then there were back then, so the picture quality from space wasn't very good. It was very pixelated, not clear, and didn't give very much information It is understandable that people thought it was an alien head thats just not the truth The picture quality now is at the highest its ever been so people can see pictures a lot more clearly. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That proves that the image was very deceving and not many people could figure out what it most likely looked like. One more thing that people should really know is that there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed. I believe that the face on Mars was not an anciet alien artifact because there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed Back in the 70's people thought that aliens were real because the technology wasn't very good, and people olny believed what they were told. In the latest years though, Scientists have no evidence that aliens are real. This proves that there couldn't have been an anciet cicilization of aliens. Because of these facts, I believe that the face found on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact becaue rock formations can be found on every planet, pictures can be deceving, and there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed.",
    "Have you ever awoken to the arrogant, angry shriek of your alarm clock on a Monday morning? Maybe you have even experienced the arctic splash of freezing cold water falling over your back as your mom struggled to pry you from a deep sleep. It is apparent that waking up for school each morning is one of the most dreadful moments a student will face. A potential solution to this issue is the introduction of online classes and video conferences Through this much more compatible, modern way of learning, students would be less restricted and undoubtedly happier. By establishing the opportunity to attend classes from home, students will be able to spend significantly more time with their loved ones obtain important skills including responsibility and time management even be able to improve their sleep schedules. Recently, it has become difficult for students to spend enough time at home with their families, or even to establish a strong social life. Between countless extracurriculars, hours of homework, and demanding jobs, there is hardly enough time to relax, let alone spend time with anyone. By allowing students to attend classes at home, they will be given endless, new\u00a0opportunities to enjoy their families. It will become possible to cook breakfast with their parents or play outside with their siblings. This improved way of learning will also allow for more time for students to make memories with their friends, an important part of any child's life. The importance of family and friendship is undeniable in the development of a child's mind; therefore, it should be more easily available to students It could be argued that instead of creating online classes, students should just eliminate activities like sports or clubs from their unbending schedules. However, these extracurriculars\u00a0actually account for most of the social skills and companionships students must gain to grow as people Involvement in extracurricular activities is an active choice that students make; it is something that many youth desire, no matter the free time it may drain. School, however, is usually unenjoyable and forced onto students. Clearly, creating the option for students to attend online classes is a much more reasonable idea Through the implementation of this technological advancement, students will be able to bond with their families and friends. As students grow older, they must obtain certain life skills to guide them through experiences in college and the working world. By allowing students to attend online classes, they will learn to become much more responsible. Without a bell persistently ringing to keep students on time or teachers smiling beside each classroom to remind them of upcoming due dates, they will learn to manage their time wisely and keep a consistent schedule. They will also learn to be more self-accountable and independent. Such skills are necessary in any aspect of life, and students will be better equipped as they begin their journey through college or the workforce. By utilizing the idea of online schooling, students will be prepared to handle themselves as they independently face and overcome the real world.\n Students struggle to get enough sleep because of the demanding schedule that school establishes. They usually arrive at school with heavy eyelids and stiff bodies, because it is utterly too early for them to be awake, let alone to learn. Studies have actually proven that detrimental health issues, including depression and anxiety, typically stem from lack of sleep. Because of students' biological clocks, waking up later is the only reasonable solution Without rearranging the entire day, this issue cannot be adequately addressed by school systems Thus, the option of online classes should be implemented in schools around the world. By allowing students to choose what time they wake up and begin their classes each day, they will be much less groggy and irritable. Their uncontrollable stress levels will significantly decrease, and their mindsets will positively progress. Student health should consistently be a top priority, and the most achievable step toward this is the improvement of their sleep schedules. Online schooling would largely help in accomplishing this. Online classes and video conferences have the chance to make a real difference in students' lives, if they are just given the opportunity. This advanced version of learning would create bonds between students and their loved ones, provide important life skills to children, and improve student health and sleeping patterns. By implementing online classes, students will be able to discover an entirely new world of learning. School will be much more enjoyable, and students will even progress into better people through online schooling. Make online classes an option, and observe as students become much more engaged in not only the world of learning, but in the world itself. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
    "Middle school, where the days seem to drag on hour by hour, just waiting, living until the next bell. Millions of students across America suffer from this treacherous cycle everyday. Although millions suffer from this process, not all students go home just to repeat it all over again. A large majority of people participate in at least one extracurricular activity no matter if it is just being on the student council, playing sports, or simply being in the yearbook club, it makes school so much more enjoyable. Not only does this give teenagers something to look forward to after school, but it also give them something to strive for in and out of the school day. These activities also teach students a variety of essential life lessons that they could never learn in school. students should be required to take part in at least one extracurricular activity. people can learn time management fall in love with something that they would never have tried it forces people to figure out their main priorities in life. People often find themselves overwhelmed with how much they have to do and how little time they have to do it. Taking part in more activities outside of school can help to teach these people how to manage their time properly so that they can avoid the overwhelming feeling that drags them down. students might not get to their homework because they have taken too much time to do other unimportant things since they are unable to manage their time. This can be fixed by giving these people something else to work on so that they are required to be disciplined enough to get everything done. Learning time management also helps students receive more free time\u00a0than ever before since they know to do the important things first and be done with it. These time management skills will also help people much further down the road of life. Many young teenagers are often too timid to step out of their comfort zone on their own, so sometimes they might need a little push to get started. There are so many positives to trying new things like joining clubs or sports Extracurricular activities can do so much for people in life and some will never get to experience that drive and love that comes with those activities. If these students never try something new they will miss and opportunity of a lifetime and miss out on so many friendships Michael Phelps' mom made him sign up for swimming as a precaution because she did not want him to drown. After that, he ended up falling in love with the sport and going farther than he could have ever imagined. A large majority of middle school students have absolutely no clue of what they want to do in the future or what their main concerns are because they have nothing to worry about other than school Extracurricular activities would help them figure out what their main priorities are exactly. If they are concerned about these activities, it would help them make better decisions in order to keep those priorities straight. These responsible actions would assist in the process of figuring out what students want to pursue in the future and therefore make it easier to accomplish a goal because they would have been working towards it for a long time. there are countless reasons why students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities, some specific reasons being that they teach proper time management, could show you how much you love something, and assist in figuring out main priorities in life. There are so many positives that they outweigh any negatives that could arise. These life lessons will expand and travel so far with people in their journey. Some students may never do these activities after middle school, but at least they will have taken a small part in some of the most moving learning experiences ever known to school system. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
    "i argue you that we keep the electoral collage because of its many pros Taking away the electoral college would be like taking away an important part of our U.S history the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. With the electoral college there would be more discussion on the topic of making smart descions to electing a president Keeping the electoal college will keep a professional way of electing a president. The electoral college selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee (and the trust given is rarely betrayed). With that said, it will be a fair and most likely a cheat free zone. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast When a run off happens this creates pressure of the voters, until the help of the electoral college comes in, which in this case helps break everything up and claim a true winner. For example, in 1968 nixon and clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college, 301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively. And that concludes why i argue you to keep the electoal college and not popular vote. ",
    "Have you ever been on the road and almost got into a wreck? Majority of the time these accidents are caused by negligent drivers. These individuals tend to ignore the rules of the road, and operate their motor vehicles while on their mobile devices which results in 1 out of every 4 accidents. Is a text message, or the next level of Candy Crush more important than your well-being, and the welfare of others. In many cases accidents are caused by distracted drivers. As the National Safety Council has reported, phone usage on the road can lead to 1.6 million or more accidents a year. This leads to a total of 390,000 or more injuries and deaths a year. This is a fairly large number and the problem needs to be dealt with. Due to these shocking statistics on distracted driving, a law or regulations must be put into place to prevent these tragedies. For instance, the government could implement having fining to any individuals caught with their mobile devices in hand. However, in most cases this won't stop an individual from doing what they want. So what I propose is a two strike law. This would implement at first heavy fining. However if the individual continues to cause problems, it may result in the permanent suspension of their license. The question now is; What happens to the individuals who cause deaths do to their negligence? Simple, They will be fined and imprisoned for vehicular manslaughter. You may be wondering why my views on this subject are so harsh? It is quite simple; I have been in an accident due to distracted drivers. When I was young riding around with my mother, a distracted driver rear-ended us, taking off the bumper. The shocking part is, if my mother had slowed down even a little, I would not be here to express my concerns. I believe that all people should strive for safety when it comes to driving. As many wise elders say, \"It is not the road you must fear, but the other drivers.\" Finally, I wish to express how distracted driving could be permanently purged from the world. Due to the increasing advances in technology, companies could begin to create self-driving cars. This will eliminate any potential risk of distracted driving, due to the fact, the individual is not driving. However, with the people who may not have the means to purchase such a vehicle, I recommend either purchasing a taxi such as an Uber or Lyft. The real productive way to stop all distracted driving would be to simply put down the phone while driving, and if it is a serious emergency pull to the side of the road where you are no longer a danger to yourself or others.

    "Warm and soothing waves of light, the eloquent smell of nature and the outdoors, summer is indeed here. For some, summer is a much needed break from the institutional grind of schooling in America, however for others it irritates their stress. Often, students worry about the projects assigned over the summer, because they're usually tedious and require an exorbitant amount of time to complete. Although it is noted that they're a source of stress to many students, schools maintain that these projects are needed to continuously engage the students in the learning process. This predicament can be resolved by allowing students to design their own projects, which adequately shows their learning throughout the summer. Summer projects should be student-designed, to engage students in learning, allow them to be cooperative amongst\u00a0each other, prevent the monotonous nature of education in America. Students in America struggle throughout their life attending school while accepting the burden of friendships, family and other stresses and anxieties. Summer becomes that safe haven for them, to completely decompress from their issues and take a break from the mental strain of schools, with all the tests, exams and projects that're encompassed\u00a0within it. Students who are allowed the opportunity to design their own project become eager to create a product which displays their learning over the summer. Once in my freshman year, I was given an option to complete a teacher-assigned book report, or to construct an independent book report. Being allowed this opportunity made me eager to chose a book that satisfied my interests, and not be punished to endure reading a four hundred page book about trivial history. This point illustrates the impact that student-designed summer projects can instill, without the students feeling punished by the school. Learning should be a process of critical thinking and analysis, however when this process is interrupted by an external predetermined body it is detrimental to one's education. Cooperation is a skill which gives people the ability to build upon each others strengths and weaknesses, and is the source of many significant discoveries. Often we see that the scientific community caters to its researchers by promoting peer-reviewed journals and research to be conducted. This sentiment holds true with education in America. In order for students to learn over the summer, they should be encouraged to produce their own projects with individuals whom they spend their time with during the summer. I recall being pestered by taking on the burden of conducting a lab report by myself, which caused me to feel stressed out and disengaged. One day in physics class, my teacher allowed me to conduct a lab with many of my friends to make the lab procedure dynamic. I found that by being with my contemporaries, I was inclined to learn more about physics, and to collect accurate and precise data. Students who create their own projects are allowed the opportunity to learn through cooperation, which betters suits them especially during summer break. Many students are already flustered by the work load they receive during the school year, furthermore projects in summer break should bring students together in learning not steer them away in frustration. We've all seen the stereotypical depiction of education in today's society. Classes upon hallways upon schools of mindless zombies who've been bombarded with unfulfilling tasks, which demoralizes their sense to learn. Why should summer projects further foster this reality into summer vacation? Isn't the point of summer break to allow students to have time to themselves? Education is a crucial institution in America, however we must not mistake it for being the only source of learning. Learning is a life skill that ascends the classrooms and school hallways, and enters the hearts of students throughout this nation. To allow students the chance to dictate their own project gives them empowerment to extend curiosity and discovery to outside the classroom. Having done project based learning in school, I can undoubtedly state that the monotonous nature of school deprives students our freedom to learn without restrictions. Of course the material must be covered, the criteria and standards must be met and the exams must be taken, but summer time is different. Summer time should be the students' time, therefore permitting student-designed projects gives students the freedom to learn unrestricted without the monotone school structure. Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed to produce engagement in learning, cooperation amongst students and disrupt the monotonous school-oriented learning process. Education has always been a field where curiosity, and desires to innovate have been facilitated to bring about improvement in society. We can't always judge the circumstances to which things are, without providing a valid solution as to how those things ought to improve. Summer projects is that annual cycle where this principle can be enacted in the future. Projects designed to be student oriented can reinvigorate that desire for young people to go research and explore, while shattering the illusion of what education is depicted to be in America. What better way can we allow the continuous process of learning over the summer, than by putting the keys of that exploration in the hands of the future generation?",
    "In a Presidential vote, does the country ask only one person about who they want for president, or the whole country? You could only imagine what only having one person's opinion could do to this country. Having people vote as a whole seems to be very beneficial to America, and may be beneficial to you as well. Sometimes it is better to have multiple people state their opinion before you make a big decision You should seek advice from multiple people because it will help make your choice easier, give you different viewpoints improve the outcome of your decision. \n This takes some stress out of your choice because then you know what the majority thinks. At the end of the day it is still your choice to make, regardless of what anyone thinks or says. There are an endless amount of decisions that people seek personal opinions on no matter how serious. When you're going out to eat with a group you ask them where they want to go. The NFL or NBA Most Valuable Player isn't chosen by just one person, it's asked about by fans, coaches, and players to see who the majority thinks deserves it. Now this does not guarantee\u00a0the right choice will be made, but in the past it has proven that it has the potential to be helpful. These different viewpoints could really effect your on view on a decision. Many people make poor choices because they are biased towards what they think is right. Most likely you will not get the same opinion and view on a situation over and over again. No matter how you look at it it's beneficial. Either you receive the same view over and over and it makes your decision very clear, or you get different viewpoints and a new way to look at the situation. With the help of trustworthy and honest peers, your decision is a lot more dependable. Hearing what others believe to be true tends to help. You have to remember to ask trustworthy people, and even then your decision may not be a good one. Even some of the smartest people in America, including our president, congress, and all of the houses ask for opinions from the people. Sure a few bad choices have been made, but I strongly feel the good heavily outweigh the bad. I also believe that the good outweigh the bad on even tiny decisions made day to day when you have multiple different perspectives. You can't go wrong with other people's help on choices no matter how big or small. You should seek advice from multiple people because it will help make your choice easier, give you different viewpoints, and improve the outcome of your decision. It is truly better to ask around for help on a topic then choose on your own. The are way more benefits than downfalls. For instance, out of all the presidents we have ever had, we've had many good ones and few bad ones With different perspectives you can either add to your argument or see through another persons eyes on why they think what they think. Would you rather take the risk of making a poor choice or receive insight on what you should really do? ",
    "Have people ever wanted to know if seeking out multiple opinions or getting more advice will help them get a better answer?\nWell today is that day.\n I will be doing research to see if asking for more advice and multiple opinions is better.\nIn my opinion I think it is. people get a more broad look at what there is it might change peoples ideas for the better, if you get more advice from people, you can see the outcomes of what they did. If people want to see what other choices they can make they can ask others.\nMost of the time the person people ask will likely have chosen a differnt path than another person.\nWhich means that there is a higher chance of people geting multiple opinions by everyone.\nPeople will most likely have a better choice if they ask more people for help them.\nWhen people ask for more advice it is always better for them.\nOut of 10 people that ask for more advice 9 of them will have a better outcome than the people that didnt ask for more than 1 opinion.\nWhen I get a broad look on something I normally have a few better choices that I will make. If people are ever questioning if the choice they are going to make is bad then they should ask for advice.\nBecause, when people hear advice from somebody else it could change their whole perspective about the choice they were going to make.\nWhen people hear advice or multiple opinions there is a higher percentage of them being more succesfull than others that dont ask.\nAsking for more advice is always helpful because it can help people choose a better job or a better car. By seeing the outcomes of what they did people can see if the outcome is positive or negative.\nIf it is positive people should probably take this advice and learn form it to make better dicisions or make a good choice.\nIf the outcome is negative dont take this advice because it might lead people down the wrong path.\nIf someone find two people with two good opinions and they dont know what to choose they should choose the one that fits them the best.\nIf they dont find one that is good for them then they should go with what fits them the best.\nWhen seeking multiple opinions and asking for advice to make better choices people should always make sure they find advice that fits them best.\nPeople schould always do this just so they have a better outcome.\n These are a few resons I think asking people for more advice can help.\nWhen asking for advice people get a more broad look at what there is, it might change peoples ideas for the better, and if you get more advice from people, you can see the outcomes of what they did.\nPeople should always have a better outcome when they ask for advice.\nThere are more ideas on why asking for advice is good but the ones I stated are the best ones.",
    "I agree because all\u00a0students should do something fun and move around Most students would rather sit than play sports, so they can still do something active with the yearbook. All students should at lest\u00a0do one activity rather than academics. This decision should be allowed if a student wants to do a activity or not. Would you want to participate in a extracurricular activity? I agree because students move around when playing sports Most students that play in a team could play the sports that they like. You can start feeling healthy after a game of any sport, and students can enjoy the nature when there outside. Students can help out with yearbooks, as a result they can design the front cover of the year book Lots of students like art work from the front cover and will want a yearbook Students can serve on students council which helps other students with disorders. They will be appreciated in what they are doing for others and the rest of the students will be happy. thats why I agree, so students can be active during school hours. Some students would rather sit and work with the yearbook. Some just want to help other people in the school. All academics should be for one half of school time and activity the second half. The activities would help students refresh their brains and forget the things they are going through. ",
    "When looking for important advice you usually have a \"go to person\" and then multiple people around you that you ask what to do in the problem you are having Talking with more than yourself, one other person, or five other people is an amazing thing to do because if you only talk to one person about your troubles than they may get annoyed with you or could be a fake friend When you have more conversation with people are what you are think you can see both perspectives you have more knowledge to what you are talking about lastly, improving your life skills food, drinks, pets, names, school, you name it. You can do it whenever, it is like asking someone if they like dogs or cats better, most people are quick to jump to the answer\u00a0and that is bias towards the animal that they like better. When you talk to other people even that are not like you, you can see why other people like dogs or cats and their pro's to it. It's just like taking a poll in the classroom or bar graphing who is wearing a different type of shoe, but you are taking the knowledge and exporting it into your decision. So, next time talk to other people so your not bias and you get to see the positive and negative of your decision That quote is one-hundred percent true because you gain so much more brainpower when talking to others. Most adults when they are having a hard time deciding something they ask other adults, and that usually brings down the negative part. What they don't understand is when you ask a kid they can turn your idea into something brilliant that you may of never thought of. Taking to kids is even more smart idea to do when it is something fun because then you can bring their fun into your idea and make it more exciting. Next time don't just talk to people your age, talk to everyone around you. More outgoing people don't even blink at the option to go and talk to someone when shyer people need a little help, and seeking other peoples opinions during school or outside of it is a great way to get people out of their shell. Talking to someone is more then a life skill it is a everyday skill and that is why it is so greatly important. The best way to improve at it is to do it. The next time you want advise\u00a0talk to more than yourself, one other person, or even five people. While you don't need to go and talk to everyone off of the street or who you walk by you don't only want your thoughts in your head. When seeking other peoples opinions you can see both points of view, have more knowledge and common knowledge, and finally have better life skills. Try it out and see how better your own opinions come, I'm sure they will come from weak one to stronger ones it a matter of days.",
    "Studies show that students lose information over the summer break, if thats the case then the solution is to keeping working during the summer. some schools have summer projects to keep students from losing any information. The option for the projects are either that they are teacher-designed or student-designed I believe the required summer projects for students should be teacher-designed it allows the teacher to chose what subject they work on, if students designed it they would make it too easy, the teacher can make it fit each students level.\n some subjects in school are more important than others, like math is more important then king tut of\u00a0Egypt. Students may not realize the importance of some subjects and chose a different one to do their project on. An example is when I chose my sophomore classes, I decided that choir was more important then my history class. Making that choice ended up meaning I knew less about history, I had to take the lass later on, and it kept me from seeing how crucial history is. Teachers on the other hand have a better clue as to whats more important. The teacher would know what subject is most forgotten or which subject will be best for the student to learn. That is why the summer project should be teacher-designed.\n everyone knows kids like to slack off when we can. We skip work, right fake answers, and cheat to get out of doing all the work assigned. If the subject of the project is left for the student to chose then it might not do them any good in retaiing proper information. When the student is told to find something to do a project on they would probably find a topic they recently did well in or something far beneath there skill level. An example that shows this is when I had to chose a format for my final project in my honors English class. I could chose between many different things: a regular essay, a research paper on the events of the story, or even a rap song that explains the book. I chose to write a letter as one of the characters because it didnt challenge me as much as the other choices If given the chance a student will almost always chose the easy work which is why a teacher should design the project so that the student is challenging themselves and growing. Next, \"All men are not created equally\" is a quote often used by teachers when telling kids not to compare themselves to others. This reinforces that a teacher should create the project because the only person who knows your academic level other then you, is your teacher. Teachers pay attention to the students and see how much help they need and where they are at in terms of their learning. In my 9th grade year I had a science project. It was the exact same project as everyone else had. My teacher realized that it would be too easy for me and I would get nothing from it so she gave me a harder one. If she had not have payed attention tome as a student she woudn't have seen where i was compared to the class . This is a perfect example as to why a teacher should create the project, so that the teacher can give the students projects at a level that is achievable for them but will also keep them on track. People might argue that the students should have their own choice as to what they create it on. The students free choice would come out during the creation of the project meaning it could be perfect for them and then they work on it in their own way I believe the required summer projects for students should be teacher-designed because it allows the teacher to chose what subject they work on, if students designed it they would make it too easy, and the teacher can make it fit each students level.\u00a0",
    "In all honestly, getting rid of the Electoral College is for the best. It's unfair to the voters. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be easier for the people. because the candidates don't go to states they don't have a chance of winning, because of the winnner-take-all system. The candidates only focus on the tight races in the swing states. Sorce 2 also claims that in the 2000 election, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all! That's pretty rediculous. And voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad. In the Electoral College system, voters dont only vote for the president, but for electors, who also\u00a0vote for the president. Then again, in source 2, the article says the the electors that were voted for can vote for anyone they choose. That's some tricky business. \n Voters can't control who the electors vote for. Electors aren't even voted for by the people. They sometimes come from state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes even the presidential\u00a0candidates themselves. The second article says that the legislature is responsible for picking the electors. And these electors coukd always go against what the people want. Article 1 says that to Electoral college is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress. Doing away with the Electoral Cololege is the best thing to do for the people. IT's unfair and tricky. The people deserve to be respected and not cheated out of their vote by electors.\u00a0\u00a0 ",
    "When asking for advice on any topic don't just take one persons advice. When you are asking people for there opinions, always ask more then one person peoples opinions can get mixed up in what there family and friends say, also what they read or watch. Three ways to avoid getting 100 different responses are ask a person you know is good at that topic apply it to the real world, and what not to do. If you are trying to find advice one of the best people to ask are your friends especially if they know the topic. Most of the time your friends will tell you anything you ask, but sometimes they are just saying stuff to either act smart or they actually are smart. Remember to make sure this friend never\u00a0lies or tells you false information. Another group of people you can ask are your teachers, parents, grandparents, or even your uncles or aunts. All these people are older than you and have more experience in the real world. They also can probably answer any questions you ask.\nAnother group of people you can ask are people who have already been through the situation. Once you ask whoever is reliable to you, take the information you got and apply it to the real world In real life the ability to learn and apply what you learned is very important because if you cant apply what you learned then you will be limited on alot of different things. Math,history,english and science are all aplications to the real world. In gy you have to apply the rules and the mechanics to play any game. For example driving if you cant apply how to drive to real life then you can't drive.\n Sharing it is also important because if you share your advice you might get some back. Make sure you are the trustworthy one and never spread rumors. Make sure you are an expert in one atleast one subject. Asking someone good at that topic, applying it to the real world and sharig your knowledge are three ways to not get 100 different answers. Its not easy to give advice but sometimes you can.",
    "In my ophion, technology reading students emotional expressions is the dumbest thing ever First, the apps they are using just changes the student indivaully like you can not make someone be happy on a computer you can make them look happy they should not change someone for who they want them to be vs what they are. Second, you should not change a photo or use any edits because thats changing you and you should just be you if you dont smile thats okay dont let people judge you on how you look you should impress your self not somebody eles. Third, People today need to realize that changing someone in any type of way could hurt them even worse. Yes, messing with peoples emotion or sometimes trying to figure it out whats wrong with them can set off alot of things. Instead of making someone look happy people should talk to the person that is upset, trying to be there for them maybe thats all they need or tell them soemthing postive to brighten there day. In Conclusion, I think changing someones pictures to make them look like they are happy is the wose idea ever because deep down they know they are, but do you just because someone makes and upset face dosnt always mean they are.",

    "In this essay I will be giving an argument on why this so called \"face\" is not made by aliens.\nThe prompt tells you that one of your colleagues says that it is created by aliens.\nMy job in this essay is to tell why it isn't and give an explanation.\nThe figure that NASA saw was a so called \"face on mars\".\nThey claimed that it was in the shape of a human head and it was thought to be made by aliens. In my oppinion this is not made by aliens. Here is a reason why.\nAll these years NASA has gone to a two or three planets looking for aliens.\nThroughout the years how many have we found, none! Yes, we may have found some traces of aliens, but we can not prove that these are actually alien tracks, or alien lifeforms.\nThere is no way to prove that this structure was made by aliens, unless we have images of them, and so far we have none. Look down on earth.\nHow many mesas or Buttes do we have in America, or even around the world?\nNow think about this, were these man made? No, none of these land formations were man made!\nThey are formed naturally by nature.\nNow over the years we have found a lot of reasons how Mars is sort of like the earth.\nIt carries water, and it is one of the easiest planets to get to, so if you think about it, Mars could have the same land formations as we do!\nNature is a beautiful thing, and it more than likely made this so called \"face\". Yes, you may be right in some way.\nYes, we have found traces of aliens over the years.\nThis COULD have been made by aliens.\nMaybe they are trying to connect to other life outside of their planet.\nThat is the only argument that you have against me. The argument that isn't even factual.\nYou are going off of a guess in your mind. So overall in this essay I have covered three thing.\nI have covered my first argument, which is that we have not found aliens even though we have been searching all of these years.\nI have covered my second argument, which is that nature has formed many structures like this on earth, it could have been formed out of the land.\nAnd I also covered the rebuttle, which is that there is a possibility that this was built by aliens because we have found traces.\nSo in conclusion, this structure was not built by humans, this was land made.

    "Venus is the closest planet to us in our solar system, which means we should explore it. At least, that is what the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" believes. he does not support this claim very well as he gives only one vague reason to explore it, he names several dangers and obstacles of exploring it, provides very few actual solutions. \n First of all, he does a good job of naming the several dangers and obstacles of exploring Venus such as the extreme atmosphiric pressure. The main problem though, is the temperature wich as the author states, \"average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,\" (Paragraph 3). This poses a problem as most metals and other materials melt at such high temperatures. However, the author fails to give very many solutions to these issues. \n The author only provides two solutions to the numerous problems that he previously stated. Those solutions were to stay above the atmosphere where it is not as hot, and to create mechanical computers that were more reinforced. These solutions would be all well and good had he not brought up a problem with the first in which he states \"peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only little insight on ground conditions\" (Paragraph 6) thus, it is not a true solution to the problem at hand. But maybe there is good reasons to keep trying to come up with new ways to explore Venus. Sadly, the author only provides one vague reason for which scientists should still try to come up with new ways to explore Venus. This reason of his is,\"It may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system\" (Paragraph 4). The problem with this is that it does not go very deep into why it being similar to Earth matters. A scientist at NASA might understand any signifigance in that statement, but an average person might not. For that reason it is a very weak argument. In short, The author does not support his idea for exploring Venus very well because he only gives one vague reason to explore it and he names several dangers and obstacles of exploring it while providing very few actual solutions. Had he named more solutions and reasons to explore Venus it would have supported his idea far more. He named too many dangers without ways to properly combat them, which is why the author's support for his claim was weak. ",
    "As a student, if I don't understand something in class, I will ask someone about it. Whether that is a teacher, a student, or a parent there is almost always someone who knows. If any one of these reliable sources does not know, I can most likely look it up on one of my devices that has the internet If we were to introduce the new FACS technology, it may have unindended lasting impacts which could be detrimental to our society. It was mentioned in the passage on paragraph 6 that \" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' \" The first reason that it could be bad for our society as a whole is that it is not the computer's duty to explain how to do everything and to change to our will. While computers were made to help us, it cannot be our only source of information. On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.\nWhen you are in highschool, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of \"In the real world\" and \" Highschool is preparing you for the real world\". Later on in life, \"in the real world\", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help. The second reason why this could be bad for our society is the accessibility. Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannnot afford it to have a disadvantage. The third and final reason why this could be bad for our society as a whole is simply that people may become less sensitive to reading other peoples emotions. Without needing to have face- to- face human interactions to see how people are feeling, it could result in a decline of being able to recognize emotions in facial expressions.\nI learned a few chords on the ukulele this summer. I could piece together a song or two. Now after a few months, I can't remember the first thing about playing those chords. This example shows that if you learn something then don't do it for an extended period of time, it will take a while to relearn how to do it. Although reading emotions is nothing like playing ukulele, the same holds true; if you learn something, and rely on something else to help you do it, it is going to be hard for you to re-learn how to do it again. People also have a right to privacy and some people may not enjoy those particular rights being breached. I am a person who does not let all of my emotions show. Other people may bottle these feelings up in hopes that nobody will see. If people want to keep in how they feel, they should be able to do that as it is what they want. Because it is not the computers duty to exlain everything to you, not everyone has accsess to this kind of software, and people may lose their sensitivity to the fine art of emotion reading, I am in opposition of implementing this FACS technology.

    "In the Westminister system, the head of state and or government is elected by the majority of both houses of their respective national legislature. In the popular vote system, the head of state and or government is elected by the majority of the nation. Unlike the Westminister system, the popular vote system has a vast array of ways to carryout the elections. Tyrants sway the people and if the people are sovreign we can't let them hold all the power when they can easily be misguided. For the safety of freedom against tyranny and for the safety of the people's sovreignty; the United States must ensure the continuity of the Electoral College. The united states of america is the oldest surviving republic in modern day times. This is because our founding fathers were some of the greatest thinkers in american history. the idea of the electoral college was heavily influenced by the English system of government and also the Iriqouis Confederacy though it is usually unrecognized due to the fact that many americans, at the time, thought Native Americans were savages. One of the principles of English government the founding fathers used was the idea of electing heads of the nation. in the United Kingdom the Prime Minister, i. e. the head of government, was elected by the majority of the house of commons and then approval by some higher authority to ensure the vote was valid and legitimate. Our founding fathers were afraid of a popularly elected dictator who would bring down the principles of republicanism and democratic institutions. So the Founding Fathers decided to create a system where the head of state and his office where responsible and questionable to the Federal legislature; the United States Congress. He could be impeached by congress if he had committed crimes and removed from office if he was unfit to carry out the duties he was entrusted with. The electoral college was made to ensure that despotism never happens in the United States. Adolf Hitler was never elected to any office, he was appointed to the chancellorship of Germany by President Hindenburg because Hitler held the people's trust and approval. Benito Mussolini was appointed Prime Minister of Italy by the King because he had the people on his side. This cannot happen in the United States because we have the Electoral College. the electors of the President are ordinary people that no one really knows whom they are. the electoral college is not democratic and it was not supposed to be. This is representative democracy or republicanism. According to Richard A. Posner,\"...the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\"\n Governments are flawed and some are so corrupt and abusive that their extremitites cannot be mentioned. The United States government and congress have always had the interests of the people in their mind. However, there is a rising faction of people of the united states that want to remove the electoral college, one of whom was Richard Milhouse Nixon who was the 37th president of the united states and was the only person to resign the office due to unconstitutional scandals. because the Electoral College is not democratic enough that it should be done away with. According to Bradford Plumer,\"The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.\" What many forget to realize is that the Electoral College is a Presidium for the elections, it presides over and gives the real vote in the elections because it comprises of random people representing both the states and the states' populations This is representation in the election process. The Electoral College is the people's representation. It was made by the Founding Fathers of the united States for a purpose. though many not approve of the Electoral College, many of our nation's greatest presidents were elected by it like John F. Kennedy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson. To ensure the safety of freedom against tyranny and for the safety of the people's sovreignty; the United States must ensure the continuity of the Electoral College.",
    "The culture of the cars is a easier way of transportation for the people, yet do the people know that these cars are space consumers and cause smog in most areas of the world. By just reducing the amount of cars invarious locations the amount of space would increase the therefore make town or city more accessable for the large population. this change of culture may benifit the population by just having the public transportation and biking. To begin with the space comsuming in suburbs makes it hard most people make a living in the tight area and having the certian parking areas may be the only way to have the space needed to get to where they need to be, yet its all timed. this makes people more tense when they had to worry of a parking spot. The people in Germany weren't allowed to park the sides of the road and have drive ways unless they payed an extra $40,000 along with a home. As said the text Vaban, had completed a trend of separating the car use from the surburban life, this is what they called the 'smart planning'. Aslo to include that other areas of the world such as Beijing, China, has to worry more the amount of smog polluting their air and making people ill. In Paris, France, diesel fuel was blamed for the pollution because most of the cars were made up of this fuel. they were rank the most polluted area comparedto other locations. to reduce the amount of the complaints of the lack of space and pollution the want to either rid of the cars or just buy more plug-in-cars and hybrids for cleaner air. Not to mention, that in Bogota, Colombia they completely banned the cars from their country for a day to promote an alternative transportation and reduce the smog. the voilators are faced $25 fines. the stress level has dropped and therefore has madeit easier for the people to more around and not get so aggrevated. the culture of cars has been a issue for someyears and in some areas very diificult to handle therefore they have created a more effiecent way to make life easier for most people. the world has to reduce the smog and increase the space for more compact living and larger populations. By not to get rid of the culture car completly but to just reduce it can be benificial to the people and the world. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 ",
    "Venus is a very dangerous planet and has harsh storms, earthquakes, and a bad atmosphere. But despite all that, the studying of venus is more important than worrying about the dangers that lurk there. In the article \"The Challenge of\nExploring Venus\" the author also supports this claim pretty well. In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He explains that Venus has very harsh conditions that you couldn't live there or even land there without surviving for only a few hours. It has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 % Carbon Dioxide, there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere, and the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees. They even say such conditions could crush a submarine or melt any metal. the author still thanks it's important that we study Venus in the future. He goes on to say \" why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?\", and then explains that astronomers are facinated by venus because it may well once have been the Earth-like planet in our solar system. The author suggests that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. He even states \" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.\nThe author gose on to say, \"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" \"Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?\".\nHe begins to say that NASA has an idea for sending Humans to study Venus. It would allow scientist to float above the scorching ground and just hover in the air. studying venus is more than important than worrying about the dangers of the planet. The author states \" striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavours. Out travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\". In conclusion the author supports his opinion on studying Venus is more important than worrying about dangers. He supports this opinion by stating that venus is a crazy planet but still says why we should explore. He even says Venus could've been most Earh-like planet out there, and earth still has similar features.",
    "In the modern world, we are almost completely dependent on our technology to get us through the day.\u00a0 These human creations, such as, cellular phones, the internet, computers, and cars make it easier for us to perform everyday tasks.\u00a0 But for such heavy use of these items, there are side effects. Cars in particular can, and will, create lasting issues in our environment, which if not resolved will cause many problems in our future. if the First World states like the UK, France, Germany, and the U.S. were to cut down on car usage, we would see a drastic decline in not only the air polluting greenhouse gases expenses for families spending all their money at a gas pump. we would see an increase in other things, such as the amount of exercise and public people would acquire through alternative transportation. The foremost issue is of course, the environmental effects of cars.\u00a0 According to the New York times, cars are on average responsible for \"12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas\".\u00a0 These emissions can often make cities uninhabitable.\u00a0 In places such as Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other urban centers; heavy pollution requires citizens to wear gas masks, and acid rain devstates plant life.\u00a0 This heavy pollution has such an effect that it causes black snow in Russia, thousands of miles away.\u00a0 But the scale of the problem is much larger than acid rains and black snow; our planet is heating up, and greenhouse gases are to blame.\u00a0 If you want evidence just look at our neighbor, Venus.\u00a0 Roughly the size of Earth, scientists believe that Venus once has water, but look at it today, and you will see our solar system's hottest planet.\u00a0 Several million years ago Venus was overcome by volcanic activity; of much greater extent than anything ever seen on Earth since it's formation in pre-cambrian time.\u00a0 These volcanos spewed thousands of tons of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere, and thus began the greenhouse effect.\u00a0 The sun's rays would pierce through the smog and reflect off of the surface of the planet, but when they went back up the smog stopped them and turned them away, back down towards the planet's surface.\u00a0 This caused the planet to practically absorb all of the energy and heat of the sun.\u00a0 Before long the surface temperature became hot enough to melt lead, making Venus utterly uninhabitable.\u00a0 If nothing is done to stop atmospheric pollution, this is our future. But in our modern world many people would be completely lost without a car, it has become the staple of our infastructure, not unlike the horse from years past. But there is evidence in the small town of Vauban, Germany; that life without cars is a very possible thing.\u00a0 The small community of Vauban has forbidden cars within their town, and the results are suprisingly positive.\u00a0 Of the residents of Vauban, seventy percent do not own cars, and are very happy with their circumstances.\u00a0 As Heidrun Walter said to the New York Times, \"When I had a car I was always tense.\u00a0 I'm much happier this way.\"\u00a0 While other states might not have such successful car free zone's, Colombia has an annual car-free day in their capital of Bogota and surrounding cities.\u00a0 This day often has millions of Colombians biking, and walking from place to place.\u00a0 There has also been an improvement in city beautification according to an article by the Seattle Times, \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks . . . and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\"\u00a0 Not only does the restriction of cars help the environment, it can also help the economy. The average American citizen's budget consists mainly of two things, housing, and vehicles.\u00a0 But during the recession of 2008, there was a decline of about nine percent in average miles driven.\u00a0 The burden of gas prices and car payments became too much for many unemployed Americans.\u00a0 But after the recession passed, the decline continued, and may soon accelerate.\u00a0 The New York Time states that \"Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate.\u00a0 There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age\".\u00a0 If this trend continues, then we have already taken the first step in curbing our greenhouse gas emissions; and by doing so, we may increase the living standards of our citizens who would have more money.\u00a0 As well as repurposed government funding in other cleaner and faster forms of transportation due to a lesser need in road construction and maintainance. Finally, the world we live in today is changing, and with always increasing technology, it may not be long before a clean alternative to gas burning vehicles arises.\u00a0 But you cannot count on the unknown; and what is known is that should we continue on our current path, the world will be a very hot place by 2040.\u00a0 Either we must change, or our cars will die with us.

    "I believe that \"Driverless Cars\" are the next big thing to this world. Millions of people use cars today and have a chance of injury or worse. If a car could drive itself or be more alert of things around it, the problem of crashing wouldn't be there anymore. The beginning of driverless cars is already here so why be against something that has already made the world a safer place As it says in paragraph seven that they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves without any human touch.\nThe reason I am not against driverless cars is that a person close to me was saved from a car crash with a automatic brake system. If that person was to have moved alittle more without the brake system they wouldnt be here today. Another reason is if a car could drive itself there would be more time to get stuff done on the way to your destination If your a busy worker or a kid with homework due, then during that time you could get things done. On the other end of the argument, we haven't come that far to make a driverless car. Sometimes machines mess up and cause problems and that could happen to this. There should be a button or something like that to switch a driverless car back to a normal car. We just dont have enough technology to do a driverless car and to make one now would be dangerous. But in the future these cars could make things alot better for the world. Car crashes wouldnt happen and the pollution from cars would be alot less because of how much gas they take. They will make the world cleaner and get you to your destination faster. In my life time I hope to see a driverless car and get to be in one. People that are not aloud to drive like the elderly or teens without a license could go anywhere without any danger. \nThe idea of a driverless car is just amazing and I know im not the only one that would love to see one. In the future normal cars should be tossed and recycled to be made into new driverless cars. I would feel a lot safer being behind a car that knows everything then being behind my two hands. ",
    "\"Thank god I got to talk to mom, dads advice was horrible.\" Generic_Name said, as he finally learned how to tie his shoe. This is just one of many instances of how getting more than one person to help you with something is beneficial. Some people think that more than one opinion can be confusing or make people over think but in the end it helps you more than it hurts you. 2nd or 3rd opinions can make you look at things from a different point of view, it can also make people reflect on a bad decision finally it can make someone better at giving advice. Therefore multiple opinions are great and can really help you grow as a person. It could make you change your mind or even make you see something from a way you never could've imagined. For Example, lets say you wanted to go out late with your friends to watch a movie and your dad says yes, but then you run it by your mom and she reminds that even though it's a Friday night you have a game tomorrow. So you take into account what your mom says and you stay home. The next day you score 3 goals and one of those goals were the game winning goal. Now what if you had listened to your dad who had disregarded the fact that you had game and complete forgot. But thankfully, you listened to your mom who reminded you that you had a game although you completely forgot. This ties back to the fact that 2nd opinions make you look at things from a different point of view. You could've easily just gone to the movies with out remembering that you had a game. But because you asked your mom she reminded you that you had a game and saved you from trouble in the next morning. Another example is, when people are hurt or sick and they go to the doctor sometimes that first, second or even third doctor dont know whats going on but if you choose to accept your fate you'll truly never know whats going on. Now imagine that you went to that 5th doctor and he helps you realize that that head ache wasn't from working out. It was from lack of sleep. Now your on the right medication and living your best life. All because you kept asking you now have headache free days this ties back to the fact that second or 3rd opinions\u00a0can make you look at things from a different point of view if he had just quit he would still have that headache but the 5th doctor made him realize that the headache wasn't from working out it was from lack of sleep. If you make the wrong decision even after you get advice from multiple people maybe you won't need there advice at all next time. For example, if you had forgot to do homework even though your teacher had reminded you to do it but your friends told you to play video games with them instead and now you have an F in the class maybe next time you'll go with your gut instead and just do the homework. This ties back to the fact that multiple opinions can help you reflect on bad decisions because now you know that school comes first and you won't need to ask anyone when it comes to that. Another example is what if you want to go out with your friends but you know if you go out this weekend you cant go out next weekend so you ask your first friend and he tells you to just go out but then you ask your other friend and he reminds you that theres a big party next week. You end up listening to your first friend and miss the big party next week all because you were inpatient. Now next time I bet you wont miss the party. If you here different perspectives from multiple people it will help you be more wise and maybe next time you will be able to help out other people. For example,imagine your brother asks you for advice on how to make the baseball team and you remember that multiple coaches told you the most important thing was to always hustle so than you tell your brother that and he make the team. This reflects on the fact that multiple opinions can make you more wise because if he hadn't known about that who knows maybe his brother doesn't make the team. Another example is, imagine you friend is nervous before a test but you remember the advice all the teachers gave you. You give him the advice and he gets an 100% on the test. Without your advice he would've failed. Therefore multiple opinions will grow your wisdom and that will help others as well. In the end multiple opinions are a key factor on everyday success, like said in the story it helps you look at things from a different point of view, it can also make people reflect on a bad decision and finally it can make someone better at giving advice. Therefore it helps you more than it hurts you so you should get multiple opinions in life you never know how it could benefit you.",
    "I think that you should choose Policy 1 because a lot of parents text their children either when they will be picked up or if they are going to be late. Also if you don't have phones at school and a parents tells the student that they will be here at three but they were late, then the student would be waiting outside for a long time until his/her mom or dad came to pick them up. In addition, if a student is really sick and needs to go home, they can call their mom or dad on their cell phone. For example, I got sick in school once and I felt so bad, so I went to my locker and called my mom and asked her to pick me up from school. Another reason why we should have Policy 1 is that if you get sick and have to use the school phone to contact your parent, then you would have to remember your mom's or dad's number, and if you didn't then you can't go home and you have to toughen out the rest of the day. In addition, if you can have your cell phone in school then you can communicate to your family if something has happened to someone or you forgot something. Also if you forget something at home, then you can use your phone to see if your mom or dad would go back and get it for you. In addition, when the school has a jeans day, but you forget you can call your mom or dad to get your some casual clothes for you If you enforce the rule more and give out detentions and take away the phones if the student is using it in class then maybe some of the students would pay more attention to the rule and not use their phone during class. That is why I think that you should use Policy 1. ",

    "Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four-time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous, and people should avoid talking while driving. Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always must be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people. Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So, the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.\n Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepared to help you in an accident. Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.",
    "I don't believe the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. First of all, the research showing there is a lot of chance to know about the distance. It's hard to make the online or video to offer the distance. Because when the students are in online or when they try to make video they are not going to take care them self. For example: I remember when I was six grade my friend PROPER_NAME was making online video. We went to classes from home to know how far it is. On that time she just focus on her video she wasn't focus on her way. After that, she try to cross the way but she still making video. She didn't saw the car she try to cross the road. So,she got some accident because of the video and she just focusing what she is doing. The most important way is to offer the distance classes from home is using map. It's easy to know how far or how close it is. Other ways, the students have to take care there self when they are in the way because there is a lot of car. For example: when I was tine grade I remember my friend PROPER_NAME she was eleven grade.\nShe try to offer the distance for her friend by making video. When She was school from home. Then, she started showing the way. On that time, she wasn't take care her self because she was focusing the video.\nNext, she try to cross the way by raining. She didn't pay attention the way and she got car accident. On that time she passed away she died. I agree some students think they would benefits from being able to attend classes from home. But most of them are not going to take care them self because there are not focusing the way. They just focusing what there are doing or they just focusing online or video. In conclusion, I don't believe the students would benefits by way of online or video to offer the distance. There is other way to offer the distance from classes to home. ",

To illustrate, we all like that \"Cash Money\". And all cars need gas to work, and the funny thing about gas is it cost money; alot of money actually. So if the limited useage of cars happen then, is we save that \"Cash Money\". As you can see the reduction and limiting of cars can save us that \"Cash Money\" the limit of car useage can and will improve health by making people walk. You see people every where are getting over weight. So by makeing them walk or use other modes of transportation we can lose weight and improve health.

    "I profoundly believe that the United States should not keep the Electoral College the person who has the popular vote may not win presidency, the \"winner take all\" system causes voters in certain states to not feel like they are creating an impact The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers established in the constition. The electoral college consits of 538 electors and a majority of 278 votes. In our voting system even if a candidate receives more votes than their opponents he or she still could lose the election because of the electoral college Here is a prime example, in the 2000 election Al Gore won the popular vote but because he had less electoral votes than Bush he unfourtunetly lost the election. According to Bradford Plumer \"over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" It seems rather logical that if somebody gains the most votes in an election that the country would prefer that canidate to be the president. For that reason alone the reader should side with the idea to abolish the electoral college. Now besides somebody receiving more or less electoral votes, perhaps the candidates tied. In this case it gets thrown to the House Of Representitives which will cause a Wyoming Rep. with 500,000 voters to have just as much say as a California Rep. with 35,000,000 voters. All a tie would do is corrupt the voting system even more than it is. For those reasons there should be an indefinite ban on the electoral college. Additionally the winner take all method in some states makes voters feel unimportant. Some may argue that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president but regions do have the power to swing an election in an enourmous way. An effect of the winner take all system is candidates not going to certain states if they know they can not win it. This can basically stop some voters from wasting time and voting because they may feel there personal vote would make no difference. In the 2000 election \"17 states did not see candidates at all.\" according to Bradford Plumer. How could somebody possibly feel engaged in an election if whoever is running finds there vote unimportantant to them winning the election. In conclusion it is official that the electoral collage is unfair, out dated, and irrational. With that being said we should abolish it because it stops the voter who has the majority of votes from winning, and can undoubtably make voters feel unimportant. ",
    "Many today are so concerned with driving safely. There are so many things that could go wrong while behind the wheel. But can having a machine drive you around that you have little control over be less hazardous? No doubt cars that have an automatic driving system will be less work to do on our part but is that really safe? Well, what is teh definition of being safe? Safe is what you feel when you are out of harms way. When you feel as though nothing can hurt you. Like there is absolutley anything that could even slightly put you inthe way of harm. But if your driving in general, do you think you are safe? No because anything could happen. So what makes you think that \"driving\" a self-automated car would make you feel much more safe? Would you not feel as if you are purposely putting yourself in the way of harm? As many say we can not change the roads but we can change the cars and make them smarter, hence the name smart cars. These cars come with many sensors within and outside of the car, including a sensor on the roof. Not only are there sensors but there is also a camera near the rearview mirror. All of the technology put into the making of this car is sure to make you want to but it. Not only that but haveing the latest technology like this in your car will also make you feel safe. There are also laser beams that update a 3-D model of the car and what it is surrounded by As much as there are many sensors in these cars to make it safe there are still some things that can go wrong. what if some of the sensors begin to malfunction This can cause an accident in the case that you are not even aware that some or one of your cars sensors have stopped functioning correctly or just all together stopped working. who's fault will it be if some fancy technology in our smart cars malfunction and its begins to cause accidents? As much as we may feel safe, there is always a chance that something is not right.\n Smart cars are created to steer, speed up and even brake with no help from a human. So does this car require any human assistance? Yes, but only when trying to get through construction areas and other accidents that may have occured How will someone know when to take over? Well, the car can make the drivers seat vibrate, there willtouch sensors that will make sure that the driver stays focused even if they may not really be driving.\n With this information we may ask ourselves: \"Are smart cars really safe?\" The answer is opinion based and we all decide for ourselves. We are all given the choice to put our lives in the path of death and we are all given the choice to remove any injurous obstacles from our paths. No one can make the decision for you. Before \"driving\" one of these \"smart cars\" many should look at the pros and the cons and do much research to determine wheather he or she believes that tehse cars are safe.",
    "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author presents both the positive and the negative aspects of driverless cars. Therefore, the author never takes a side on the matter. This response will side with the argument of being against driverless cars driverless cars promote less disciplined actions with not only adults but with teen drivers. automated cars would not benefit the economy, it would damage it even further automated cars put safety features at risk compared to having an abled-human to do the driving functions manually. Driverless cars can promote less disciplined actions among teen and adult drivers This assumption is made because, driving under the influence, as well as underage drinking are huge topics of discussion in today's society. Driverless cars would give these two groups of people an exscuse to commit these actions. They would no longer have to worry about the reproccutions of such crimes. Such as putting other's lives in danger or getting caught by the police. Automated cars would not benefit the economy in any way. In fact, the cars could worsen the already bad financial situation America faces now. This is because of the following quote from the article. \"Originally, many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads.\" \"These smart-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.\" These direct quotes further express to society that these automated cars require very new, very expensive roads. driverless cars put saftey features at risk compared to having an able-bodied human to do the functions instead \"Most driving laws focus on kepping drivers, passnegers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.\" This quote speaks entirely for itself. the best option for society is to not have driverless cars because, they promote less disciplined actions with teen and adult drivers, they would not benefit the economy, and finally these driverless cars put safety features at risk compared to having an able-bodied human to do the manual functions when presented them.

    "Losing the privilege to drive can be upsetting, all the work that's put in just to get the privilege to drive. Driving is a privilege that we earn and lose, this essay discusses the ways to lose and keep the privilege to drive. There are multiple ways to lose the privilege of driving but one way is by using a electronic device while behind the wheel. Most people believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones,texting,etc. while operating a vehicle.\n Driving while talking on the phone can get others and the driver hurt . One example could be hydroplaning. Hydroplaning is caused by traction and sliding on a film of water. Using one hand for driving and the other hand for the phone while it's raining is a creation of an accident and getting the privilege to drive taken away. Your driving privileges would be taken away because the driver has a phone in their hand and it's not allowed to have a phone in the vision of the driver behind the wheel. Another example would be of course texting and driving because once again there is a phone in the hand of the driver instead of both hands on the wheel and no one paying attention to the road. This could lead to an accident because many drivers don't know where they're going and the car could lose control. Driving with a device in your hand is a distraction because your attention should be focusing on your surroundings and the vehicles on the road. To keep from getting hurt and jeopardizing your life and the life of others,drivers should follow the Hands Free Law. The Hands Free Law is a proposed driving law that states that a driver shall not \"record or broadcast a video\" on any mobile phones, iPads, computers or touching any part of their bodies while operating a vehicle. Even with the Hands Free technology, drivers are not allowed to write, read, or send any messages or emails, but voice to text is allowed. Voice to text is a form of speech synthesis that converts text into spoken voice output or when the speaker can speak into their device and it translates their words into a text so that the speaker is able to answer the text message or any other important subject. Driving is a privilege. Responsible drivers should always pay attention to the road and other drivers. Cell phones should always be out of the drivers hand so they may maneuver the steering wheel and not drive reckless. Drivers need to remember that driving is a privilege and that it can easily be taken away from you. ",
    "Cars have made an impression in human history. They have been used to get from point A to B for decades. They may help us but they also can hurt us. Gas emissions are hurting the environment and smog continues to grow. Some governments have already implimented ways to reduce these emissions. These have helped the problem and it may even be to our advantage. Many cities have already sought out ways to benefit the people that have chosen npt to use their cars. This limiting of car usage has benefited many countries and the trend seems to be catching on. In the first source, Elisabeth Rosenthal writes that it has made peope even happier than if they had had a car It has also helped reduce traffic in normally busy streets. The most obvious benefit and advantage to having limited car usage is the fact that the reduced car use has reduced gas emissions. Limiting car usage can be beneficial to the environment and it can also be beneficial to you. It can make for less stressed people. In Source 1, it describes how in a small town in Germany, many people are getting along fine without motor vehicles. As a matter of fact, some even said that they were happier without a car. Heidrun Walter states that \"When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way.\" It may be less stressful because the goverment there had designed that town so that everything they could need was within walking distance or could be reched with public transportation. Many cities have already adopted this idea including New York. Source 3 has also asked people of their opinion and businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said \"It's a great opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" Carlos had said this while riding a two-seated bicycle with his wife. Walking, Hiking, and even bicycling have been generally seen as a way to destress and relax your tensions. Stepping away from the car and just walking may just be the stress reliever you needed. A usual sight to see in busy cities and on main streets is the amount of cars that jam the street alway the way up during certain hours of the day. This can become increasingly annoying to some people that can be on their way to school or job. A car-free day has had a very succesul turn out in Bogota, Colombia. Source number 3 described the streets of the capital of Colombia to be \"Eerily devoid of traffic jams.\" on that day. So many people might have participated because violators would be fined $25. This car-free day was intentionally placed to promote alternative transportations such as biking or public buses and to also reduce smog. Another example of a type of car limiting was seen in Paris, France. Paris was near a record amount of smog in the air with \"147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London.\" - Source 2. Paris took action to try and reduce smog with this simple method: Leave cars with even-numbered license plates at home or face a $31 fine. They proceeded on to the next day with the same concept but this time instead of even-numbered plates, it was odd-numbered plates. This reduced congestion by 60 percent in the capital of France. One of the more obvious advantages of limiting car usage is the amount of emission that can be prevented from not using your car. In Source 2 it is stated that after 5 days of limiting car usage \"the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.\" After just five days of the imposed fines, gas emissions into the atmosphere was reduced significantly enough to lift the ban. If five days made such an impact it can also make a huge impact if many more people were to start limiting their car usage. Car usage has already been falling in the United States. In source 4 it states that \"New York's new bike sharing program and its skyrocketing brdge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorites, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.\" This is talking about how all these factors have come to reduce car sales and car usage in general. Less cars equals less gas which would then equal less air pollution. there are many advantages to limiting your car usages. You may not only be helping the environment but you may also be helping yourself. Using your car less may even make you a less stressed individual. It has been shown to reduce congestions in busy streets. It has also helped reduce gas emission. Limited car usage has started a trend in many countries and may even be a trend here. It can give us these advantages and many more. ",
    "I belive my claim for or against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions are invading our private space What i'm trying to say is what if they computer says the wrong things or if we feel something that could be embarrasing or offended it'll cause us to either become more emotional or angry/offended. I believe you will also be taking jobs of those who have went to college to major in this type of senarios If you are taking all of this for people to have it on a computer software then you are no better than hispanics or immagrants taking people jobs because it'll lessen the chance of people even knowing or wanting to become in their life. we need to advance technology to better help people people still have their rights and beliefs and you would be crossing the line in my opinion if you were to believe this idea. I say let the professionals handle it who are in some ways the same way cause the computers would be screening us humans when there are other professional humans to relate or more capable of helping someone than a software and if the system goes wrong then what will you guys do then? What i'm trying to say is just let people who can relate and have diplomas for this kind of stuff let them do their jobs stop replacing humans with machines",

    "Driverless cars are coming, no matter how much you may like it. They have their many pros and cons, they still need to be driven by a human to get in and out of a driveway, or to navigate a crash or roadblock, and how it went over 500,000 miles without crashing (paragraph two). This still fairly remarkably, even whilst it is still in it's prototype stage. Although still proving to be an expensive alternative to normal cars, driverless cars can have the potential to be an incredibly safe method of transportation, as compared to human driven cars. They can be proven even safer to both pedestrians and policeman alike, by being utilized by people under the influence of alcohol, to drive home safley, and not harm any people utilizing the sidewalk or other drivers. Although having to be driven by humans to do things like drive into driveways or navigate traffic, which would ultimatley void my previous statement on how it could protect passersby. Remember that these cars are still in the prototype stage of their lives, and developers are still working hard on making these cars as skilled as a driver as any human. These cars are coming closer and closer to becoming a reality that could be in every house by 2020. Much like everything else, they have their pros, and cons, but ultimatley prove that ve are one step closer to a better, safer tomorrow.",
    "The future. Everyone wonders what it will look like, what it will be like but that is up to our future generations . The young people today will eventually be our future. They will be the ones we look up to for solutions and ideas. By having extracurricular activities be a must in schools we are only making school systems better and by making school systems better we are making our future better. There are so many fun yet different extracurricular activities\u00a0for everyone such as dance, student council or debate. Schools should make participating in an extracurricular activity mandatory for students\u00a0 it will give the students a chance to explore their passions, it will provide them an opportunity to make life-long friends it will benefit the schools participating.\n By providing students the chance to participate in extracurricular activities, you are letting them get a head-start in life. By trying out different activities, they will be able to determine which one they like the most and want to pursue as a career. Many students in high school\u00a0still don't know what career path they want to pursue, but students who had to do an extracurricular will already know which one they prefer to others. Thus, they won't be puzzled by the time they have to choose a career. Additionally, participating in extracurricular activities will help strengthen their resume when they need it. A student who has done multiple extracurricular activities will be preferred to another student who has not done any. Furthermore, my sister, Generic_Name, never knew what career she wanted to pursue until she took a building class as an extracurricular in 9th grade. She instantly fell in love with it and could use that extracurricular class as a bonus on her resume. She is now in her first year at Yale, studying engineering. This shows why extracurricular activities will help students discover their passion. Every year, many new kids will move to the area and come to a new school so providing an additional way to get to know others is needed. The new kid will be able to connect with others that share similar interests and it will make the whole moving process much easier. In addition, having a friend that shares the same interests as you will make your bond much stronger and make you much better friends. This program will also benefit shy kids or students who are more quiet and reserved. It will help them because in school they might be more quiet if they don't feel comfortable or if none of the subjects interest them. However, if they are in an environment where they enjoy what they are doing and are with\u00a0people like them they will be more likely to branch out. When I was nine, my school required I do a sport. Thus, I decided to do swim team. When I started the sport I was new to town. We had just moved from California to Virginia so I did not have many friends. However, I made many friends quite easily because of swim team. I made friends faster than usual since we shared similar interests. We all liked swimming and we would all have friendly competitions. We even took trips together which made our bond even stronger. We helped each other\u00a0through hard times. Even though, two of my friends from swim team switched schools I am still very close friends with all of them. The bond we created will last a life time. It will keep students busy and occupied; thus, they won't get into trouble as much. I was once told that if you are bored, it\u00a0can often lead to trouble because if you're busy you have no time to make trouble.\nAlso, by having students do extracurricular activities it will seem as if the school gives off lots of well rounded students who have many skills. This will seem very impressive. Lastly, the school's students will most likely have a higher grade point average (GPA) and better scores in general compared to schools who don't require extracurricular activities. This is because\u00a0studies show that students who do extracurricular activities\u00a0such as sports or clubs have done better in academics and will learn time management and balance better than other kids. This is why enforcing extracurricular\u00a0activities will improve schools. schools should adopt a new policy of having students preform at least one extracurricular activity. This is a great way to help students find their passion, make new friends and better the schools. Students will be to find an extracurricular that sparks interest for them and hopefully it will turn out to be their career. They will also be able to make strong friendships through this program. It will also ease the anxiety of making friends for new kids. Lastly, the program will benefit\u00a0schools by making their students more well rounded, increasing the overall GPA of their students and help keep students occupied and out of trouble after school. In fact, all schools in America should decide to make this a requirement. Not only will it make our school systems better but it will also improve our students; which are our future. The students in our schools today will eventually become leaders, officials, activists, doctors, lawyers, actors and politicians. So if this program will better schools and the lives that hold our future then there should be no question about implementing it.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
    "the autor suggestds that we should explore venus, personally i think it not a good idea but the author really does not support it and gives great examples to why we shouldt go out a study this beautifle planet called venus. on paragraph 3 the author really gives us great exam-les of the problems of exploring this planet one great exaple that i think will convince people from not going is that the authomosphere of venus is really thick and it is 97 percent carbon dioxcide which is bad for us , and also the temprature on average is 800 degrees which is pretty hot. As i saw read this part i noticed that the author isnt really against studiyng this planet he supports it. On paragrapgh 4 he tells us that venus is simaller to earth becasue they have terrains just like ours, valleys,mountains ,and craters. The author also shares with us and writes that Nasa's possible solution to exploring or studying this amazing planet without having to touch the surface is float above the fray use an aircraft that is like blimp. This will only help them see the surface but they wont be able to collect rocks or soil which will be harder for them One way Nasa is already working to be able to collect rocks is by using the computer used during World War 1 called mechanical computers. they can make calculation by usinf levers and gears. that way when they are up ther and send robots these can last longer and take data in, casue the modern computer tend to be fragile to heat. And in venus there is alot of heat. i believ the author really gave good details to why it is a good idea to studybthis amazing planet and really supported it now will see what time will show us if we are the right thing like the aouthor writes \"we should meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

    "i think that changing the school policy is not a very good idea. Most kids have a C or higher, but just because they don't have the grade required, doesn't mean they cant participate in sports. Many kids don't do very well in school, but sometimes they do sports to get their mind off of things. Some kids are very fanatic about sports, and that's what they like doing. Maybe they even want to have a future that has to do with sports. But not letting them do what they like , just because of not having a B or higher, is not a good solution . And if they do a test , and she/he didn't do well, they just lost their ability to do what they like. Some kids think that sports is their life, and that is the only thing that matters to them. Another reason why you should let kids participate even though they don't have a B or higher is, that the United States is one of the country's that has they most obesity in the world. And some of the kids need that exercise to try to maintain fit. and just because they don't have the accurate grade for it, is not a good idea.",
    "Some schools require students to complete projects over summer break to assure that students are still learning while on break. Many of these schools and their students have mixed opinions on if these projects should be teacher designed projects or student designed projects. I believe that these projects should be designed by teachers to ensure that students are staying on school related topics so that these projects for students can stay related to school related topics to fully ensure that students are still learning while on summer break For projects with the intentions to keep students learning while on summer break the first issue would be students making projects on subjects that have no relevance to school, this would be very inefficient in the efforts made by school boards to keep students learning.

    "I think that students should get at least a grade be average to participate in school activities. student should play sports to get more athletic, but should also learn to keep their grades good Sometimes you get good at sports, but your grades can be slipping away, so I think you should let students participate in sport but schools first. This is how you should let students participate in sports or other activities, so school first, activities like sports second. Also having fun activities including sports or other games can wait, work on finishing school work or homework before activities. For students, they have to know how school is very important and can affect their future if they don't take it seriously. activities like sports including football, baseball, basketball, or soccer are very athletic an fun activities to do, you need to earn good grades before doing any other activities. I know how many people like to enjoy a lot of outdoor activities that can is very important to maintain your health, but you should make sure the students are doing well in school before letting them play any sports. You can still let them play some after school activities that involve sports or in the class physical education that tries to get you to be more athletic. support your idea of get a good grade before playing sports or other activities.",
    "I really don't think that making students do community service should be made a school requirement. Maybe a better thing that you can try to do with community service is maybe make a sign up sheet where all the students that actually want to help people and actually want to help their community can just sign up to do their community service to help. In my personal opinion there is no point on making students that don't want to help people or their community do community service at all unless they do something that is actually bad and have no other choice. The reason for why I think this way is because they probably won't even do a good job when doing it, won't feel good about them helping, and will just see no point in doing the community service that they have done. Also sometimes they have something that they absolutely have to do at their house or maybe it can be as simple as having to go somewhere that had a very important reason. Community service, it takes up your time and its usually from stuff that maybe they have been planning from maybe even a really long time ago and have been looking forward to this for a long time. Homework can also be an issue here sometimes. Maybe because they had to go to perform their community service thing they had to miss doing their homework or just didn't have time to do their best, and when kids sometimes miss their homework or just don't do their best in class, it can really drop their grade down by ALOT. Now I know you don't want community service or anything to come in the way of having a good education. ",
    "Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. That might a good idea for some students but not all Today, many High Schoolers from the age of\u00a015 to 18 have jobs. They work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. Sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. Going to work after school is very overwhelming. They get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. That goes on days after days. Many students can get stressed out easily So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. Staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready\u00a0early in the morning to go to school. That might not be a big problem in summer or spring. But winter is the worst time of the year for students. The sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. It gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. Nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasn't even risen and frezzing weather outside. Of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. Leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. You could ask the teachers directly if you don't understand, and I think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. Plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. So in the bottom line. I think it's better to combine both ways. The students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. They can take classes online since they can't make it to school. Cut the students some slack on some Fridays. They can stay home and attend classes online. Or only apply on seniors. Because it's their last year and they have lots of work to do. But in my opinion. Attending clases online or directly at school don't matter. What matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ",
    "I think students should be required to take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service they can learn more better education by just being apart of something achieving in life as in doing their school work, getting good grades, being dedicated and representable to the respect in the school policy i also think students should really take a thoughtful moment about rather the community service activity should or would waste their quality time at home just wasting a lot of time ands not really learning about anything important. i think that it is right to establish that all kids should be required in cleaning up all of the junk that has been abandoned our important community i also believe that students should do the right thing and pick up of what they have done as in throwing trash on the ground and thinking it is cool, i don't believe deep down inside that kids and adults should trash and liter up our community like this. and i truly possibly think that kids should think about keeping our environment clean and be supportive.",
    "Have you ever needed advice? Have you ever thought about asking more than one person? If not here's why it's always good to ask more than one person for advice.\nmultiple opinions Have you ever asked someone for advice but it didn't work out? That's why it's always good to ask more than one person because you can get variety of choices and It means unique and different opinions.

You and your friends after decide to go down a water side so you ask one of your friends if you should go with he says yes. you ask your other friend if you should he says no because you won't feel good after. This why asking more than one person can help you make better choices because people have different view of things. This can also help you by getting you out of trouble because asking other gives you a different type of perspective a different way on how to handle things.\n Different point of view ever had problem and needed help or needed a different view of things? well you can by asking for others advice this helps because you can get a different point of view of the problem and different ideas on how to handle it. for example Generic_Name has a history test in a week and he's not sure how to handle it so he asked his friends. His friend Generic_Name says to make a mini quiz for him self and see how he dose. His other friend Generic_Name says just make a study cards so Generic_Name went home that day and look at the different ways he can ace the test. In conclusion asking more than one person for advice is good because it helps you out and can help\u00a0you change as a person.\u00a0",
    "I know you set high standards for us to achieve and you will get those soon, but in the mean time, I believe to participate in sports you should at least have above a D. I believe we should support this because some students just cannot get things as fast as others and they just can't admit it, it is embarrassing and they will probably feel they don't have the knowledge and they will just get more depressed. Also they are trying their hardest.\nAlso if you are so concerned you should just hold an adolescent-to-adolescent tutoring, you know peers teaching each other, because sometimes kids can just explain it in an easier and more comprehendible manner. This has been proven to work in other countries and also bring grades up 45%. I believe this have caught your major attention. Many kids are not able to participate in these sports because of the new 'school law' you just brought up I have learned these kids do these sports to blow off steam and also just to not be ticked by anything tiny, like a fly set off their temper. Technically, you have just risen the bullying rate to 76.5%, yep, I just went there... You need to remove this \"law\" off this campus as fast as you can, ASAP! Change the law to: If you have a D- you will need to stay in after school teen-to-teen tutoring until 3:03.\nIf you do this just would be doing this whole school a big favor in everyway.\nI would love to say thank you and hopefully we would do more friendly adult v. teen in the future.

    "People ask for advice for many things that they might struggle with most people are able to help by just giving them their opinions. Some people ask for advice and opinions in topics such as school, work, and sports. It is important and completely healthy to ask for advice or help. When should you ask people for advice or their opinions? You can ask whenever you might need it or want it. For example in sports, work, and school. you can ask anyone if they ever need advice. With something or someone, and you can help them by just listening or talking to them about it. And mainly try and understand what they're saying or what they mean about it. It can also make them feel more confident and better than they did before. asking multiple people is also good so that you get more opinions that could help you. Writing and essay in school can be very stressful and difficult. But you can help someone in school by giving them advice on a essay that they're stressed about or maybe just need some help. Another is taking a test, taking a test is very nerve racking and scary but all you might need to do is just relax take a deep breath and talk to someone and just stay positive. Games in school are fun but someone may need help with a question to get the answer right. If anyone might need help maybe just go over it with them and re-read it so that maybe they can understand and get it quicker, and get the answer right In work talking to your boss for any reason is very difficult or scary. One because you never know what they might say to you it could be good news or bad news which is always hard. A good topic is getting promoted or something very special at work that could boost your confidence into wanting to keep improving or doing better. Getting a big part at work is also very exciting and you might want to talk to someone about that just if you need a confidence talk on what might be going on in the future at work or who might be there to help guide you through everything that's going on. In sports learning new things or skills is very hard or maybe it might be easy for you and make you want to keep improving. Pep talks are also a very good way to figure out what coming that your coaches might be preparing you for in the future or before a game or your about to preform. Being nervous is a huge part of playing sports because you never know what might happen or what could happen so all you need to do is stay positive and ready to improve. Overall it is very important and very good to ask people for advice or opinions so that they have an idea about whats happening and it overall just makes them not as stressed and nervous. So whenever you think you might need help or advice with anything dont be shy or nervous to ask everyone needs advice or an opinion at some point in time in their lives. So just ask in the future and dont be scared to ask. ",
    "There is usually no way of getting out of or way of getting around having to go to school. Everyone needs education in some way, shape or form. I believe offering a distance learning as an option would help in many ways transportation issues, comfort, lack of distraction. Some say that coming to the school house would be better than being able to work from home but I can show you otherwise with three reasons, starting with transportation. Some are too far from the school house to walk, can't catch the bus, or no one is there to take them. Even the ones who do have a bus to ride, they may miss it and feel as if they're already late they might as well not show up and with that they're missing a days worth of education. Having online courses at home would be beneficial because all you'd have to do is wake up and sign on. With that it'd make things easier on the student and the people around them. Many people during their teenage years have a high level of anxiety, having to walk around a school with many people or having to present in front of a class could make those anxieties worse. When working from home students wouldn't have to worry about that, they could lay in their beds or sit at their kitchen table and work on that classwork. Also they wouldn't have to deal with the anxieties of presenting in front of 20 plus students they could simply make a video and turn it in for a presentation. Working in the comfort of their homes could make their grades improve as well because they aren't working under so much stress or pressure. Also if they are more of a visual learner there is videos online that could help them as well. Some people have a hard time focusing surrounded by so many different things going on, me being one of them, so it prevents them from getting their work done. Working at home would eliminate many of those distractions for most people such as loud talking and screaming, people walking back and forth, horseplay and much more. Being home the only thing that could distract a student is the student itself, the quality of the work will reflect that too. If they're doing what they're supposed to be doing with minimal distraction they should be okay. As stated before online courses would be beneficial to the students mentality and make it comfortable at that. I can see the reasons others may believe that learning inside the school would be better but online is the way to go. ",
    "In my opinion I think driverless cars are kinda cool because of the fact that the driver doesn't have to do much of the driving Alot of people can get tired while they are driving to where their destination is. Man people have to pull over and stop at motels or hotels to get siome rest, with a driverless car the owner can be at their destination without having to stop anywhere. With driverless cars you have to think about the facts that agt any time the car shut down and stop working but the car can alert you at anytime telling you that there is a problem with the system or something. The text provides a lot of interesting facts about theses types of new cars and on how several companies are in the process of testing them out. The text states that Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. After Google did it many other places started to follow after them like BMW who created the \" Traffic Jam Assistant\" which the car alerted the drivers when they needed to take over. Then, GM developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The driving laws focus more on keeping the drivers , passengers, and pedestrians safe and that was one of the major goals these companies wanted to achieve and they did. Tesla made a project that in 2016 this year a release for a car capable of driving on an autopilot 90% of the time. The cars they plan on working on are Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan to drive themselves by 2020. Hopefully in the future people will be for driverless cars like me because the have some good benefits of human life in the future. People can read articles about the cars if they want to do background checks if they want to. I would love the fact that we would not have to drive the entire time if I was planning on a long trip, a lot of people will change their minds about driverless cars in the future because I did.",

    "Education is key in life it helps you get on the right track to know how to help create a thriving and worthwhile future. Some students athletes forget that at times I encourage the new rule to be passed. Many student athletes feel they need special treatment just because there are in fact special; being a student athlete means you can do things that others can't! Because of that mindset, these students don't always believe that education is important to their future. I strongly disagree and believe that if we had the new rule a lot of students will buckle down on their grades in order to play.\n It's nice to be an athlete; the parties the popularity and not to mention the girls, but that's not going to get you anywhere in life. If all the student athletes kept at least a B average they could have a thriving future playing any sport they want to at a good college. Just putting a little more time into school would really benefit them in the future. Some might argue that with sports they don't have enough time for school work. In that case coaches can arrange time after practice or in the mornings to get extra study time. I being a student athlete am able to balance cheerleading, drama, chorus, and academics at the same time while keeping up my honor roll status. Its not easy but I can balance it. I've learned to keep my priorities set to where I can have a thriving future in what ever field I choose to go into. I know that fate steps in and can take the best of us and that in one freak tumbling accident I could never cheer again. That's why I keep my grades up to know whatever happens I will be ok. \nBeing a student athlete doesn't effect grades sure it can make the job harder but only if you choose to. I believe that the new rule should be enforced and followed and their athletes who really care about there future will follow it religiously. If your smart and talented enough to be a student athlete you will make the right decision for your future. So decide what you want to take out of this essay will you make the grade or be left behind while others not as talented as you take your rightful spot. the decision is yours you are the only one with the tools available to pave the road to a successful future.",
    "Would you want summer to be filled to the brim with boring assigments made by your teacher instead of enjoying some of your only time off school? If teachers were to construct summer projects they wouldn't be fun at all. Summer vacation is something to get excited for, not to dread. The teachers' projects would create anxiety for many but letting the students take the wheel could be interesting The students could think of projects to not only work their minds while on break enjoy and appreciate what they've done. Teachers have a hard time giving work that is both challenging and rewarding If they make a fun assignment, it must be easy. This is true for the opposite: If the make a challenging assignment it's garenteed to be boring. If they let the students make the summer projects they might find a perfect blend of the two. They would make something that requires skill and also happens to be exciting to do.\nThe taachers' projects would for a fact bring anxiety and depression for a magority of people becasue summer is a time for them to relax and regroup. Some teachers may not understand this concept or try to pass it off as no big deal. Students know what it's like so they could create projects that don't feel overwelming or unfair. It could be a compremise between the students and the teachers to get done the things they need to. Over the course of summer, the projects might be forgotten if the teachers were to make them because no one enjoys them. To ensure that the projects don't get lost, students would have to think of ideas that would make the projects a blast to get though. Ideas like travelling the world and recording the experience could be trilling and get the gears turning in the students brains. \n eaving it to the student population of the school to make the projects would keep these projects enjoyable, challenging, and overall painless. This project would be like ripping off a bandage really quick to get it done without pain and have fun the rest of break.\u00a0 ",
    "I think community service should be something everyone does to help others, or to help the Earth. Some people think community service is a waste of time when the air is polluted, and more people get sick per week or day from it, it is time to start cleaning up are community I think the help of the elementary kids would be great for them, so they can get work done, and not just have to ask the teacher for help, but they can ask their tutor also. they can go home after school, and have no work with a tutors help. The tutor would feel good at the end since the student they helped enjoyed the help of the work, and also enjoy meeting someone new to them. The community need to be cleaned up so our air pollution can get better than what it is right now. We should have a couple kids clean up places during study hall hours, and after school. Also, the lakes, rivers, and oceans are getting polluted from all the junk in the water. So all the fish, turtles, and other sea creatures are dying from the pollution thrown onto the ground, which can get blown into the water, or thrown into the water. I think we should have kids recycle paper and other recyclable items to reuse them, instead of cutting down trees for the paper, and make the new items. The schools should have a Recycling competition where the Study hall class that brings in the most items to be recycled, get a free day party for the study hall the whole week. The competition goes on each month. After each month, they have an assembly to get all the items collected, then they put them together to see how much they recycled that month. It would encourage kids to recycle more often, and give a little bit of a competition for the school. Community service is a good thing to help clean environment, and also help other who need it. If we didn't have community service, our community and planet would be a wreck. We need more people to help for community service so it can go by faster each day, and makes others feel good about where they live. If we didn't have community service, you would mostly be walking on trash every step you take, since some people throw their trash on the floor instead of a trash or dumpster. Some people dislike community service since they like to be inside the whole day either in front of a television, on a computer, or playing a video game. So they think community service is boring and not worth their time, but they need to learn that they can save the environment by just picking up a wrapper on the ground, and spending time away from the electronics, and go outside with friends, or pick up trash in their neighborhood. The people that do community service, should be proud of what they do to help others, and keep up the work they do. So I think all students should perform community service so we have an excellent environment, and more people can look at teens, and not think of them as a bad reputation like adults do right now. They think of some teens as trouble, bratty, and they don't do anything. But other teens are getting looked up to by doing different amounts of work to help out, and also adults think they are a good reputation since they help out more. Community service is a good deed, and not only kids should do it, adults should also be doing some community service since it is something that is excellent for the community. They put responsibility on kids to clean up, even though adults throw things on the floor too. ",
    "Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? students have their own way on learning, in school and at home. Students still should attend school for valuable reasons. Students can get more help and experience at school than home I know some students have different ways of learning, but its way better to get more hands on than seeing it online. Students wouldn't have interactions with teachers or students. Being social is good and communication is key in today's\u00a0society. Students voices should be heard and how you going to do that if your doing online classes. Some kids have trouble some time speaking or afraid to speak to some people, but school is a place where you can speak your mind and have an opinion on things and get help so you could be heard.\n Hands on is important so you can have an experience. Instead of just seeing it and observing it you be can doing it yourself so you can learn how to do things in life. School has many things so you can be prepare for the real world. Like high school, you have multiple schools that does hands on like carpentry, cooking , doing hair , and child and development. All of this is in school so you can have an experience on what you want to do or want to learn in life. I rather have hands on so I can learn how to do it instead later on in life I'm not struggling doing what could been taught in front of me. You have to take some things for granted because a lot of people don't get the chance to go to school and do these type of things. I don't like school, but I rather be here getting my education than be home doing nothing watching time go by. Take this for granted because one day you want the best for your kids and want them to learn and be successful in life and be their own boss . School in important can' t stress it enough. Looking at a screen is not going to help get the actually help you need. \nDo you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? students have their own way on learning, in school and at home. Students still should attend school for valuable reasons. Students can get more help and experience at school than home.",
    "My opinion is that we should study venus. Yes, it might be dangerous but if you would want to find out more about venus then that's the option. \"Researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.\" We wouldn't be able to see it far away. We would need to see it close up so we would be able to study and explore it. Venus has something we want to learn about, not specifically that but about it. It has so many things that we want to see and study. \"Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite it's proximity to us.\" Venus is the hottest even if it's not the closest to the sun. \"Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.\" Studying venus would be much better. We would know more about venus and it is. We would know what it has and what don't it have. \"Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system.\" Some of venus features are unknown but some are analogous to those on earth. \"NASA's possible solution to the hositle conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" \"Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky.\" Venus is the second planet from our sun. We are curious what venus has and study it. It has so many things that earth dosen't. It's a whole different planet. \"NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus.\" It might be dangerous but one day we will get to go to venus. NASA is trying there hardest to get a person to venus but we need more materials and money for that. Almost 3 decades we haven't went to venus. It's a challenge to study and get back. NASA will complete this challenge. ",

    "In recent years many citicens have stated that the so called \"face on mars\" is a martion monument. Well I have but one question for those few citicens. Do you have any proof? there is nor was there ever any real evidence supporting the martion monument claim. However there is evidence proveing that the face is realy a mesa! When we first released the origonal photo we had hoped the public would take notice of mars. Unfortunately many therorist now say that the face was undeniable proof of alien life! NASA decided that better photoes were requiered to qwell theas rummors. It took us twenty-two years to get better results. Even so the public still believed in what they thought rather than what they saw. Three years later we recieved the best results possible. the photo not only showed no carvings but it also showed that there was no face at all! Instead we found that the face was but an ilusion! Shadowes were made by the landform creating a non-existant face! \n Thus the face on mars was proven to be fake and the public became dissapointed. ",
    "Driverless cars are the new future to this planet and in technology. There needs to be a new and improved way to drive cars, even if the driver does not need to touch the steering wheel. The cars that he foresees would use half the fueld of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. the Toyota Prius that uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel which would allow you to estimate how far away or close you are to a curb or another vehicle. the safety that the car would be capable of. cost effective in the long run which means that over time, you will get your money back from the car. The manufacturers have thought of a way to allow the car to drive and think for itself and allowing the driver to relax until they get notified that they should take control. Cars that are smarter will allow you to save more money and cost less mechanically, as well as save on fuel. sensors and displays in the car that allow you to focus on the task at hand when you are driving. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver said, \"We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way.\" In the car that he is overseeing, it uses heads-up displays and information systems that will notify you of an accident ahead or a roadblock that calls for a detour. The displays can be automatically turned off which is something not available to drivers who are texting and driving. Another detail would be that of manufacturers consideration of using cameras to watch the driver to make sure that the driver is paying attention if he or she needs to take control of the car. If the driver is paying attention to the road, then he will not need to be notified and or have the company of that car be notified. It allows the driver to pay closer attention to the road and not his surroundings. Safety is a number one priority in cars and in life as a whole. If your car is safer to drive on the highway, it will reduce the cause of accidents and save you and others around you money. That is why manufacturers are considering using displays that will automatically turn themselves off so that the driver does not get distracted behind the wheel and cause a serious accident. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, which would then notify the driver that they are too close to an object and that they should stop immediately and look at their surroundings. All of the little gadgets that are put into this car as well as other cars, are allowing the driver to pay better attention to the road and the objects around him. Cars are getting smarter by the year which is reducing the number of accidents per day. Which is why driverless cars are a must for safety. The reasons stated above show how and why that driverless cars are a must for everyday life as we know it. They save you money by not having to pay so much for gas everytime you have to fill up. The car is being driver by the hardware that is inside of it and it will notifiy if you need to take over and steer. The last reason is safety. If the car is not safe, it should not be on the road. Driverless cars are allowing the driver to pay closer attention to the road as well as what is happening around him better than if he had all the lights in his face and his phone placed in the cup holder or in his lap. The driverless car is being developing to become something greater and more useful for everyday human life. This shows how and why driverless cars are a must for everyday life and why I agree with the developement and manufacturing of these cars. ",
    "Many years ago there was said to be a face on mars. Research since have proved that the so called face was just a natural landform. There are such landforms like a mesa that the scientists think is what the face really is. People today still do not believe scientists that the so called face is just a landform. I think people should believe that its a natural landform, because scientists have improved their cameras scientists know more on the topic then civilians do, and people assumed and over exaggerated too quickly. Scientists have improved there pictures since the Viking 1 took the photo. They have better quality and have done some more research. The aricle says that there cameras have improved and been upgraded. The scientists say that there are several options that the mound could be. Two options are a mesa and a butte. The people do not know as much as the scientists do. The scientists have done research and gone to school over this type of thing. They can identify it easily. In the article one said that the landfrom looks common to some in the American West. They compared it to the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This shows that the people have less knowledge in this area then scientists do. People over exaggerated it when they first found out anyway. They weren't positive that it was what they thought it was. The aritcle stated that right away people made movies, stories, and articles about it. The picture shows on the Viking 1 that it was just shadows. The newer pictures were shown to not really show facial features. Yes people could see the figure of a face, but its outrageous to think that an alien formed such thing. These facts show that it is highly unlikely to have an alien form such thing. There is more proof that it is a natural landform. But would you want people getting all excited and happy because they THOUGHT an alien existed. Its also just a way to get children to believe foolish things and maybe even give them nightmares. ",
    "Some people believe that online school is better than actually going to school I agree with this, because, some students can't learn as fast as other kids in their class and struggle to keep up with their homework and classwork, and when they start to fall so behind they begin to cheat instead of learning and asking for help from their teachers. When you do online school you are able to go your own pace no friends are there to distract you there is no one to cheat off of. Online school can be extremely beneficial to many students, because we are able to go our own pace and learn in the best environment with no distractions from anyone. You learn so much about yourself and prove to yourself that you are capable of so much more when you work hard and stay focused. Students get to feel better about their work when they do good knowing that they worked hard for that grade alone. It gives them more confidence and motivation to do even better on their next assignment. When you learn in school there is so much pressure to keep up with classwork and homework assignments and students tend to fall off and begin to cheat off their peers, on top of that some students struggle to be on time to their classes and get introuble When you do online school there is no pressure, no rush and no cheating. Students shouldn't feel the need to skip class, because they felt they weren't ready to take a test or a quiz. In school students are easily influenced and distracted by their peers in their classes and begin to start conversations when they are not suppose to. Some students tend to get bored of sitting in the same spot and begin to walk around the hallways with friends when they should be in class. Online school doesn't distract you, but only encourages you and push you to better yourself and your future. Doing online schools shows you what subjects you're good in and what subjects you may lack in, online school would break it down for you so that you can have a better understanding. Students would learn so much more online, because they are allowed to choose what time they get to start school. They are also able to speak to teachers and ask questions they would be nervous to ask in a classroom. Online school allows you to think freely without worrying about what others may say or think of you. In school some students get anxiety when they have to present a project to the class and tend to freeze up, but online school the only person you are presenting to is your teacher and that lowers the stress that some students may feel when presenting to a large group in school. Many students struggle on a day to day basis with school and become stress and lose sleep at night, because they are concerned about their grades. Online school minimizes your stress and allows you to go your own pace. It gives many students an opportunity to do well in school and allows them to explore what they want to do with their life after graduation. No students wants to spend their senior year stressed about falling behind their classes and making sure they make it on time to school, when they can simply take online school and be more focused and engaged in what they are learning.",
    "The Mona Lisa is a very iconic painting by Leonardo Da Vinci; however, no one pays attention to how her smile was constructed. According to the new computer software, Facial Action Coding System or FACS, she's 83 percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful and two percent angry. This software is very useful and can help push technology ahead. The process begins with a computer constructing a 3-D model of the face and all 44 major muscles must move like a human face. These movements are called action units. Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, classified the six basic emotions of facial expressions; happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust, and fear, and implied them to facial muscles The software can even track mixed emotions. For example, the Mona Lisa as she has four different emotions in her picture. The Mona Lisa demonstration is intended to bring a smile to people's faces., while it shows just how much a computer can do \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\". He continues to go on about how it could modify a lesson like a human instructor. This can be very useful for children and teenagers who are homeschooled and take online courses. The same technology can make computer-animated faced more expressive for video games or surgery. This FACS machine isnt very necessary for daily life, but can help in the classroom It is very cool and interesting, and can help teachers know when students are struggling. This software is going to help humans in the future and will only become more advanced. Dr. Huang notes, \"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication\". He is correct with that statement. In conclusion, Dr. Huang and his colleague did a terrific job in creating such an advanced piece of technology. This will help teachers and schools in the future. The only problem is the cost of the item, because it will most likely be pretty expensive. Making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.",
    "The author continuaslly shows that they belive that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author said in paragraph 5 that NASA was working on a \"blimp like vechicle\" that would hover over the landscape. in the same paragraph they said that this vechicle would hover at about \"30 or so miles\" above the terrain. In paragraph 5 the author said that the ship would have to stay at 30 plus miles high in order for the tempeture to stay \"at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit\". Also in paragraph 5 the text said that the \"air pressure would be close to sea level on earth\". In paragraph 6 the author includes that \"many scientist are working on innovations that would allow are machines to work long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus\" In paragraph 7 the text say that NASA has tested some \"simplified electronics made from silicon carbide\". These \"simplified electronics\" have been proved to work for about \"3 weeks\" in a \"chamber simulationg the chaos of Venus's surface\". The evidence that was displayed shows that the author and scientist think that a trip to venus would be a worthy cause. The text started out with facts about the planet of venus. Then the author slowly talked about how to safely study venus and the equipment that would be needed to do so.",
    "I think the community service is a wonderful idea The children should know that littering is a bad idea. I'm sure that they would want a clean community and have something nice around them. Some littering can cause bad air quality. That just depends on the litter Also it's better to have a nice environment. If i had things to do that was not been told, i' d be picking up litter and many things for the community would look nice when people are passing by Also it doesn't take that much time is others are helping The when everything is cleaned up, that's when you can do anything the children wants. Like for example: play in the dirt, run around, play with the equipments that's around there community, or listen to music and other many playful games Well that's all i think about how you should require all students to participate in the community service.",
    "Imagine your principal creating an extra curricular activity assignment that you have to choose whether to be in a sport, yearbook comitee, or student council. I for one would be in love with this idea. Extra curricular activities are fun, stress coping, can improve life skills. Sports to me are just my life, they take time away from school and relieve so much stress. Extra curricular activity relieve a lot\u00a0of stress from school and give an extra hobby to participate in. Taking stress away from school is a very important to a students mind.\nWith to much stress students don't preform as well as they should because their mind is clouded by all the work they have to get done that they have for later.\nStudents with lots of stress their grades tend to drop because they cannot function, but with extra curricular activities they can get help and complete their missing work with the help of others. An extra curricular activity I would recommend to students with this problem is to stay after school and get help from a teacher.\nTherefore after this session with your teacher you have completed your work and now some stress is gone.\nWith extra curricular activities students have the option\u00a0of help and they can succeed by using this method. \n Sports is a great extra curricular activity that is fun. With sports you can play with your friends and have fun. I play on a sports team and it is really fun because a lot of my friends are on the team causing sports to be more enjoyable to me, but what if you don't like sports. There are many extracurricular activities that are also fun. What I recommend is that you find something your good at and join or make a extra curricular activity about it. Extra curricular activities can be really fun or boring but if you get something out of it, than it has some type of meaning. Some extra curricular activities that you can make or find that can help with life skills is Baking,Sewing, and speaking a different language there are places near you that can help you with life skills.\nAn example of this is my mom participates in a cooking class down the street from my house and my dad participates in a foreign language class so when he travels for work he'll know how to speak in a foreign language and understand what people are saying there.\nExtra curricular activities are there to help you with life skills too. I completely agree with the principals assignment and I would recommend to a lot\u00a0of people that participating in an extra curricular activity would be a good thing. Extra curricular activities are fun, stress coping, and can improve life skills. Extra curricular activities can make it easier to suite your personal needs and help you get work done.\nExtra curricular activities can also be fun and interactive with other people. But the main thing to remember is that extracurricular activities are supposed to help with your needs.\u00a0 ",
    "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The reason is, Venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system Even though Venus is despite the danger it presents studying can helps in thr future. The study might not help now but when something happned on Earth, it surely will helps and will be worth it. Even if it doesn't help, studying and knowing good. Paragraph 5 says \"Not easy conditions, survivable for humans.\" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The conditions of Venus are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. However, peering at Venus from a ship or orbitting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere. \n In Paragraph 8, it states, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should expanded to meet the very deges of imagination and innovation.\" ",
    "Within countries around the world people are coming together, whether it be the polititians or the citizens, they are all beginning to put an end to the use of cars on a daily bases. In Germany there is a suburban city where the majority of its' streets are relatively free of cars and the residents of this \"car-free\" city seem quite content. Germany isn't alone in wanting to rid the world of cars along with the pollution and stress it brings, Paris, France is another of the handful of places that would prefer to begin an anti-car revolution. There are days in Paris that, when the smog is too much to bare and the air is hardly breathable, they are forced to enforce a partial driving ban. After about a week the air was noticably cleaner. While Vauban, Germany and Paris, France have joined the fight in kicking cars to the curb in their own particular ways, three cities in Colombia have also decided to become a member of the ever growing \"car-free\" city club by starting a program that sponsers a car-free day once a year. Taking a closer look at the suburban city of Vauban, Germany, it is easy to see the reason as to why the country would create a city free from cars along with parking spaces When thinking of suburban cities most people create a mental image of large buildings spread far apart from public homes or neighborhoods with long winding roads and intersections packed with automobiles. Considering most of the popular suburban cities throughout the world match this description, it is not completley inaccurate, but most people fail to also imagine the abundancy of smog and other forms of pollution that invade the cities because of the gaseous fumes released by cars and other vehicles. Vauban has greatly decreased the amount of air pollution in their city by simply eliminating the amount of automobiles out on the roadways. According to the article titled \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 5, cars are the cause for up to twelve percent of greenhouse gases emersed into the air in Europe while in some areas of the United States the amount of gases released into the air is around fifty percent. By eliminating the amount of cars used in Vauban, Germany they are creating friendly air for its' residents to breathe. Going back to the image most people in the world assume a suburb would look like, winding roads seem to take up the majority of space between stores and residential homes. In Vauban they have reconstructed the roadways and car garages into walkways and new stores so the residents have more access to the places they need to be. The elimination of the amount of roads and highways have helped Vauban to also put forth more money into other ways of transportations as opposed to using the majority of money on the contructions of highways and such. When reading the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 9 it states that in most of the previous bills passed has claimed that nearly eighty percent of appropriations have gone to highways while an estimated amount of twenty percent has gone to other forms of transportation. Next on the list of cities that are attempting to put an end to car use would be Paris, France. Within Paris there are gorgeous sights to see and the majority of them could be seen and reached by a simple bike ride and there is really no need to fill the air with more pollution with an unnessasary car. This is what most of the people in charge of Paris believe which is why they created partial driving bans. The smog within Paris, France can, at times, rival even the amount of air pollution in Beijing, China which is infamous for being the most polluted cities in the entire world as was said in the article titled \"Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog\" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 14. While Paris officials wanted to completley eradicate driving completley so that the smog would disappear, they knew that with the millions of drivers in Paris that it could not be completley banned all at once. To help illiminate the smog and still keep from having too many issues with its' citizens, Paris decided to make it so that one day the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be permitted to drive their vehicles and the next day only drivers with odd numbered license plates were banned from driving. They continued this pattern for a week. Of course, there were some people who decided to drive their cars whether or not it was banned, so the officials came to the conclusion that anyone who broke the partial banning rule would have to suffer a twenty two euro fine. According to the article titled \"Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog\" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 12, nearly four thousand drivers were fined throughout that week. Regardless of the people who went against this rule sixty percent of congestion was illiminated in Paris after that week. After Paris on the countdown of cities to help the cause of limiting car usage comes Bogota, Colombia. In this heated city nearly seven million people populate, they have a program where one day out of every year that cars are completley banned from use. Everyone in the population participates by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses wherever they want to go according to the article \"Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big hit In Bogota\" by Andrew Selskey in paragragh 20. By this city promoting the use of buses, taxis, and other forms of transportations they're reducing smog and the amount of traffic jams and accidents throughout their city. After three years of this day being made two other Colombian cities have joined in to participate. The cities being Cali and Valledupar, Colombia. The day without cars was part of an improvement plan that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s according to the article titled \"Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit In Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky in paragrapgh 27. By participating in this day, the people of Bogota have seen the construction of one hundred and eighteen miles of bicyce paths and added parks and sports centers all over the city. Within the United States of America there are thousands upon thousands of cars used every day, but this may not last forever Across the span of around eight years the amount of young people driving and obtaining their licenses has drastically decreased according to the article \"The End Of Car Culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 32. More people are taking buses or taxis or simply walking or biking to their destinations because with the growth in population over the last few years the traffic jams are unbearable and seem to take more time then to simply bike to work or school. If a car is used and is needed than most people in America seem to take to car-pooling with a friend or neighbor which in turn helps to decrease the amount of air pollution in the country. ",
    "The Electoral College is a process, The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requierd to elect the President.\nUnder the 23rd amendment of the Constitution, the Distict of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.\nAlso each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.\nYou help choose your states's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Personally, I think that the Electoral College has to stay how else are we the people vote for the cadidate that we want, I think that the Electoral College is doing us the people a favor of electing our candidates. I also think that is better that we have Electoral College to help us and help the cadidates tu become president and return the favor to us by making the world a better place to live. if we did't have Electoral College we would't have a president to help our lifes to be better so that why I belive is better to have Electoral College in our favor ",
    "In the booming world today, transportaion is essential. Trying to imagine life without cars for some people is like trying to imagine life without food or water, but cars arent ass essential as we think.\u00a0 But even if you drive a smart car or hybrid, emissions from these cars still affect the world around us. Lowered car use would help this improve. Using less cars would also have more benefits for all of us. People in a samll town of VAUBAN, Germany have already stopped use of cars. People report to be \"Happier without them.\" In Paris, France, the warm days and cold night would trap the smog in the air. in order to reduce the amount of smog in the air, on monday drivers with even-numbered liscense plates had to leave their cars at home or face a $31 fine. Then on tuesday, motorists with odd numbered lisence plates had to do the same. This led to decreases in the amount of smog in the air. The warm days and cold night would trap the smog in the air. Another instance is in Bogota, Comlubia, where there was a car-free day. According to buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaze, \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and to lower the air pollution.\" This has led to newer sidewalks being paved, and new restraunts and upscale shopping districts to pop up all over the city. \n Less cars mean less greenhouse gas emissions, which inturn help our environment. It also leads to less stress and deaths among the people in the city. Less cars are the future of our world, and its not too late to start to help our environment and to help better ourselves. ",
    "The Face in Cydonia on Mars is merely a natural landform if NASA has proof that The Face was created by aliens, the evidence would surely be shared with the world. Also, the Face is similar to several types of landforms on the Earth NASA has photographic evidence that the Face was not formed by aliens. As mentioned in paragraph 5 of \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the Face has \"become a pop icon.\" Because the Face has \"appeared in books, magazines, (and) radio talk shows,\" people have become brainwashed into believing that the Face on the planet Mars was created by alien forces People claim that NASA is hiding the evidence revealing that the Face is actually made by aliens. However, \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" Not only would the proof of aliens bring in an abundance of excitement for Mars, but it would also gain NASA a great deal more of revenue. NASA\nis not hiding any form of evidence towards alien-life on Mars, and the Face may not have anything special about it besides the fact that it looks \"like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" The Face on Mars is extremely similar to several landforms found on the Earth. As explained in paragraph 12, the Face is similar in design to \"a butte or mesa,\" which are \"landforms common around the American West.\" Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, notes that the Face reminds him of \"'the Snake River Plain of Idaho.'\" In the Snake River Plain, there is a \"'lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face.'\" This is evidence to support that the Face is no different from any other natural landform, and that people have no reason for speculation against that idea. Another big reason to believe this claim is because professional scientists have pictures for evidence against aliens. Scientists at NASA have photographic evidence against the claim that the Face is alien-made People who claim that the Face was created by aliens will state that the photograph taken in April of 1998 was not enough proof of the Face being a natural landform As stated in paragraph 8, the photographers \"had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face\" because \"it was winter.\" This means that any proof of aliens could have easily been hidden by the haze covering Mars So, in April 2001, a better picture was captured. In paragraph 10, it is mentioned that this time the photograph was taken on \"a cloudless summer day in Cydonia\" and that the evidence showed up with \"absolute maximum resolution.\" This picture, in its high quality, proved that the Face truly was nothing more than a natural landform on Mars. If NASA had any proof that aliens had caused the Face to appear, the evidence would surely be shared. The Face is close in size and design to a landform in Idaho, and NASA has photographic evidence that there are no signs of aliens anywher near Cydonia. Because of these reasons, one can clearly see that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. ",
    "Dear Senator of the state of Florida,\nI belive there is something wrong with our voting system. Evidence has shown that our electoral system has shown some minor errors. In the election 2000 George W. Bush won because he had more electoral votes than his oppenenet Al Gore. But, Al Gore had more popular votes than Bush. If this great country of ours is a democracy, shouldnt be the president decided by the people for the people. The electoral college has been around for 100-200 years now. When are founding fathers came to this country, they never said to have a voting system like this. The people voted and those were counted and that was how the president was decied. IN the 1960's John F. Kennedy was running for president. In Lousiana race and segragation was still happening. The legislature of the state tried to change the electoral vote so all the pouplar votes would count against Kennedy. so the votes of the voter will have never counted. But the system of working is also a good thin. the votes can be avergae easier",
    "I think that students should perform a community service because it would make our community stronger and bring us closer together in the things we do Some things we could do are cleaning up liter and making our Earth healthier. Also we can throw our garbage away instead of throwing it in the streets or on the sidewalk and if we see a person do it, we could tell them to pick it up and throw it out or we can throw it out for them if they don't throw it away. Another thing is our community can make a garden and plant vegetables, trees, flowers and other things We can do that for helping families in need and we can actually help them too we could recycle our paper, cans, and cell phones or ink cartages. If everyone recycles, our Earth would be a lot cleaner and we wouldn't have to worry about having a dirty Earth. Our community can also donate to homeless families and families that live in shelters and that would need things for their family or themselves. We can give them things like, clothes, toys, food, make up, blankets/sheets and other things a person would need. Everyone needs someone to take care of them and look out for them and they always will need someone there. The community we live in could be a lot stronger and healthier if we all just try together.",
    "In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the authors support to his knowledge of Venus is very informative. In the article the author provides information about the planet to inform the reader that even though it may be hard and risky that it'd be outstanding to be able to put humans on the planet, but because of it's \"thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide\" or blazin temperatures no space craft or human are able to last on the planet without getting crushed or burned to crisps. Venus atmosperic pressure is 90 times greater than what us humans and living things experience on earth making it impossible for someone to last on the planet, with all of its cons many would rather admire from a view but some would rather get closer. The evidence from the article that would make you want to avoid venus as much as it may seem nice and plesent the information provided would make you not want to put a foot on the ground of Venus. In the article it states that the planets weather consists of \"erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface\" not hospitable for any space craft nor human life. Astronomers believe venus to have been \"covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" According the the knowledge of the article \"the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" stateting that Venus and Earth are and where once similar at a point in time NASA believed to be coming up with multiple ways for humans to set foot on the planet without any complications, at the moment NASA's only way of getting near the planet with stable temperatures and pressure is by having a \"blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.\" In conclusion the author puts into words that visiting Venus by foot seems impossible but by the rate of the technology and people willing to help with making it happen setting foot on Venus will be sooner than many believe. In the future humans will finally reach the land of Venus but in the mean time many more features about the planet are yet to be seen and uncovered. The space craft can only provide so much information from a distance that with better technology a space craft may be able to get closer to the planet for more indetailed information. As far as that is it's closer than you'd think and the author's information and details of the planet in the article are very ear listening for any reader looking for information of the planet. ",
    "I think that students should be allowed to use there cell phones during lunch. Because it is there free time and there not in class. Cell phones shouldn't be allowed on in the classrooms, but lunch time. So I would have to agree with policy 1. You should allow students to bring there cell phones to school as long as there off in the classrooms. Just in case there is an emergency after school while walking home or waiting for your parents to get them Students should also be allowed to have them on after school even though it still on school grounds. You the principal or vice principal should allow cell phones on during lunch time, because the students are not bothering anybody it is there free time. We just maybe want to listen to music, play games, text, or call people on our cell phones I honestly believe that it is really not fair that the teachers take away our cell phones while there out during free time or some other activity Even if your at volleyball tryout's they should be allowed because you're not inside the classrooms disturbing other students your enjoying your own time. Others just want time of there own as they can during school hours, just get a break from all the homework or class work they have to do. Just for 40 minutes (lunch) of our day we want to use our cellular device. Everyone should have a chance at least every other Friday to have there cell phones on during lunch time. probably more students would get better grades in English, Math, History, or Science if you allowed this opportunity to have cell phones out during lunch periods.

    "Have you ever walked outside and taken a deep breath of fresh air but then you realise that the air youre breathing isnt alll that fresh? Thats because air pollution has greatly increased in\u00a0 recent years and the number one reason for air pollution is the exhaust from your cars. Yes, the amount of cars in the world has increaesed dramtically in the last 10 years. While this is good that the luxury of owning an auto mobile it has also put a burden on the earth and future generations. while cars have made it easier for our day to day lives the amount of pollution in the world has become too high to not do something about it now. instead of taking the modern convenience of a car what if you decided to ride your bike to work for a change. The fact that the amount of pollution is ever imncreasing should be enough of a reason to limit car usage. Instead of driving every time you go somewhere if you just rode a bike or walked when its convienient you could make a difference in the world. You dont have to completely stop driving your car but just limit the amount of times you do drive and that little extra effort will make a big difference in the long run. the world is facing an epidimic in which we could not have clean air for our future generations to be able to take their kids to the park and enjoy a nice day in the sun. it is also better for your body. When\u00a0 you decide to ride your bike or walk opposed to driving your car you are getting a work out from doing so. This may not seem like much but when you look at how often you go places the numbers start to add up. In the ten minutes that you would take to go to the bank you could spend fifteen minutes riding your bike and getting exercise multiple times through out the day. thiss can also give you much more free time to do something physically active that you ignored because of a car, with the motivation to go out pollution free you can start up running or even learn how to skate and enjoy the go. When you decide to make the change and not drive as much you open up endless possibilities for what you could do instead of sitting in one place driving. You become more active in the community and this helps the enviroment and you as a person. limited driving has been proved to be a great idea in more ways than you would think. Just doing your part can help out. the facts are all here that limited car usage is the best way to go for decreasing air pollution and making you a better you. It will help the future become a brighter and cleaner place to live. \u00a0 ",
    "I think that every student should do community service. This is because it helps out the school, the community, and it helps make them a better person. It doesn't even take that long to do some sort of service. \n But if everyone got into the attitude that if we help someone then something good might happen to them one day. If no one volunteered to do anything than the school would look bad, the community to, and no one would be a better person.\nHard work will pay off one day.\nSee if we do community service it could help the school, the community, or maybe even make that person a better person. If everyone did community service than the school would look nice and the teachers would be more organized. The community it would look clean and far from litter. The person once they are done with helping they will feel better about themselves. But where would the world be without some sort of community service to make a difference.\nBy starting a community service project the world would be a better place. The thing of it is that community service doesn't even take that long. You could do it for an hour or you could do five.\nJust a little bit counts.\nWhen you help someone for that little bit of time you are making them happy not just yourself.\nSo go do that little bit and make yourself feel better, other people feel better, and even make the world a better place. You know when you help others something good will happen to you one day. \n But if you have this attitude that nothing good will ever come out of helping someone you would be wrong. It won't happen right away but give it time.\nIf you are happy and have a good attitude about what will happen to you and someone else is happy because of you then you have done a good job. \n But without a program to do anything like this then no one will know what it is like.\nIf no one volunteered to help out with anything that had to do with work then where would the world be.\nThe schools would look really bad because if no one helped them how would it be anything.\nThe community you have people who help clean it up they do it because they want to not because they have to.\nThe people wanted to make the community look nice so that way they don't have to live in a disgusting place.\nBut if kids don't learn now that helping is good in anyway then they will be no one because they didn't try to make a difference.

    "The electoral college is a part of the constitution, it's has been used to decide who will be our president froever as long as the constitution has been on paper. Why get rid of it? Is it because we live in a world where everything is new and improved? Or because it geneuinly does'nt work? Electoral colleges are widely regaurded as an anachronism, and non-democratic method of selecting a president. So why do we need to cange the way we do things. What if something tlike the disaster factor happened again and someone voted for someone that wasnt in their party. Or if an election came to a tie what would happen then the election would be thrown to the house of representitives, where the state delegations vote on the president, because each state casts only one vote ,the single representitive from wyoming, represents 500,000 voters. but the electoral college avoide run-off elections meaning no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

    "Being bored in the middle of class really sucks. You sit there staring at your computer screen longing for the time to go by faster. Well with the new Facial Action Coding System it can read your emotions from your face and change things up a bit. These are very good for classrooms to keep kids from getting bored and going off track. When I'm sitting in class I don't like to be bored the whole time. I want to learn and pass, but I can't do that if I keep spacing out or falling asleep while doing my work.\nI want to be entertained and interested in what I'm supposed to be learning. If my computer had the Facial Action Coding System installed in it then when I began to get bored it would notice and would change the lesson or how it was teaching me. In conclusion, I believe that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for classrooms to have to keep students from getting bored and not doing their work. It would help them learn and keep them interested in the lesson. This would help students pass and keep them going for a better chance for a good career with a better education using this system. ",
    "The electoral college system is archane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely over-looked in an election. For a country that was built on the ideals of freedom and fair representation, using the electoral college system isn't right. Firstly, canidates running for president need a majority of 270 the 538 electors to win an election. Thus, they focus more on winning swing states such as Ohio, rather than winning the approval of their constituents. This immediatly shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's super-power? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote- a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, old-fashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections? Secondly, the electoral college (in addition to putting down the voter) has been proven to be faulty. Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968- these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World- the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representitives- without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy? The electoral college.\nThis system goes against every democratic ideal in the United States' foundation And yet, it is still how president after preseident is put into the Oval Office- sometimes wrongly as explained above. The electoral college is wrong. It just is. There are no valid arguements for it. It puts down the voter and, in a sense, makes them obsolete which, in addition to being extremely hypocritical, is just not right\n",

And lot more smarter, it has to have a lot of control when driving in the high speed roads. Driverless cars has to have immedantly brakes and if it doesnt it may cause some serious damage to the car. May cause an accident. Why you have to be in the car if you are not driving. If your going away for a long trip you should be driving instead of the car itself driving. Driverless car can miss under stand signals or stop working. The sensors can cause problems to it. It can be risky for the car driving you where you want to go. If your in the car by your self and going for a long trip it would be boring. You would fall asleep easily and when your not paying attention and the car driving itself can cause some serious problems. Think about you falling asleep and up ahead a sign says constructions workers up ahead and the car alerts you and you still asleep you may cause a accident. Waiting on the law should be another 5 to 10 years to check all driverless cars can do great in the roads.\nAnd all states should agree take more time. Driverless cars technogly is risky because you so use to driving youself and now they think that their company of their cars are ready. And when passengers and pedestrians get in an accident cause of the technogly who fault is it?",
    "Twenty-five years ago NASA had found something on thr planet Mars. Many people for twenty-five years have wondered if the \"Unmasking the Face on Mars' was really made by aliens and if could be a accient artifact left behind by aliens. \"The Unmasking the Face on Mars\" had probably lead lots of people to thinking that their could be a really big chance of aliens being real. Ever since the face on Mars was discoverd lots of people thought that their really could be alien life it could be just a natural piece of landform on the planet Mars. If you look closley at the 1976 picture its a low quality picture since its from 1976 than twenty-three years later in 1998 it was taken again lots of people who had seen it were not sastisfed it was a winter april in 1998 it was also a cloudy time of year on Mars. Even though the cameras took the picture ten times sharper it had been really cloudy so you could barley see the picture to have real proof if it was created by aliens. Later in 2001 they had gave it a other shot making it the most recent. The 2001 picture had still been some what the same as the 1976 picture To me its just a normal natural landform that was created itself by the planet. lots of things on earth look like other things it is just the way the landfrom is created into.",
    "I think that your first policy which is allowing us to bring our phones to school and keep it off in all classes except lunch times and at other free times is a delightful idea if i do say so my self. for example if you bring your phone and you use it and you constantly get it taken away and yelled and teachers call you belligerent student that is not going to work but if he or she changes their belligerent ways. I think that this policy will be a remedy for our problems and our action. This policy is like a compromise if you think about it would not be going your way and it will not be going their way that way they can use their phones during free time and learn during class hour I think it's a \"win win \" situation both for the children and you. Another reason why the second policy is not as good as the first is because the whole time students would sneak the phones into class. then the teacher would take it away, then the student would go to the office, and then the students mind would stay stagnant and not germinate like it is supposed to. So instead of making the conflict of cell phones more difficult than it should be you should choose policy two so that we could be together in unison instead of all of us running around like crazy people and children tell the truth that's why policy two is better",
    "As we all know that the Electoral College was founded by our founding fathers for this great country Changing the electoral college to popular vote is an amazing idea because well the people will have a more say so then just voting for an elector. In the three aricles I was given I happen to come a crooss to many\u00a0 reason why the elctoal college should be banned or removed. First of all, the Electoral College came to be because the founding fathers needed a compomise to set their differences aside to find out a way to elect the president and now that technology and human development has changed and every thing is changing why cant we change the way we elect our president. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. To win the presidential election you have to get 270 electoral vote. the electoral colege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take-all sustem in each state, candidate don't spend time in states they know the have no chance of winning. this qoute means to say that the candidates dont take the time to go to place they dont think they're going to win over but thats the problem just because the other candidate has tht state one the people in the state could probably gradually go for the other candidate values or moral. \" Its official: The electoral college is unfair and outdated and irrational\". this quote means that we as American Citizen we need to improve our voting system ou with the old and in with the new. one reason why that they should change it is because \"under the electoral system, voters vote not for he president but, for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" this quote means that instead of voting for the president your actually voting for the people who are going to vote for them. When people go voting I would think that they would want to actually vote for Barack Obama but instead your actually not. That system needs to be banned if thats suppose to be a good way to vote well then it needs to be changed because if he U.S. is for the people and by the people\u00a0 well then the \"people\" should have a more wider range of\u00a0 who gets to be the president of the United States then just someone else voting for them. To conclude the system for the electoral college should be changed and it needs to be changed. The elctoral college is a unfair and not the right way to do things and as a U.S. citizen changing it wiil make it easier for me to have a say so in who gets elected for the president\u00a0 o the United States.

    "Driverless Cars Are Coming is a short article that depicts the use of computerized cars that are being made. The cars are supposed to be safe and trustworthy. One part of the article describes a public-transport taxi system that would take people from place to place, navigating through other driverless cars. The idea of this self controlling, moving car can be very advantageous to people, using less fuel, prevent or stop car accident, and take people to their destination at ease. However, there are issues with the automated automobile. How will driverless cars adapt with cars with actual drivers? How will everyone acquire the self-driving car when they could cost fortunes? Also who is blamed if and when prevented accidents aren't prevented? Lastly what about car computer hacking? The idea of the self driving car is courageous, but it will not work for our society. First, driverless cars can drive at ease when other driverless cars are in uniform with the other cars, but when one car has someone drivng the car then the driverless cars aren't able to predict the outcome the real driver will make. Assuming the driverless cars would communicate with one another, they could all drive together in uniform, predicting eachother's movements thorugh the streets. Then one car, in a situation in which is being driven by someone, cannot be in communication with the driverless cars and the driverless car tries to predict one's movement. The driver actually goes the opposite way predicted, crashing into the other car. This is not something that can easily be avoided without other people owning the driverless car. Driverless cars are very mechanical, probably costing much more than one's average car price. Then everyone is told to adapt to the change and buy this self-propelling car, but they are much too costly. Without the car, people could get into accidents with the driverless car. No complete safety would be acquired until every single car within the set area is a driverless car. If an area with all driverless cars is made, what happens when the self driving cars do finally mess up and crash into another driverless car? Who should be blamed? The creators of the car? The person inside the vehicle that should have taken over and tried to drive for themselves, assuming they even know how to drive with little to no practice? One could also easily hack into the cars computer also. Computer hacking is already a very regular thing in the United States, so what stops people from hacking into cars and purposefully causing accidents? These types of issues that are very hard to deal with could not be easily dealt with.\nBlame for driverless cars could be impossible in some cases. the idea of driverless cars cannot be comepletely viable for safety of passengers and safety of citizens on the side of the street. There is no way driverless cars could be able to completely predict a real drivers movements. The cars could be hard for everyone to buy and adapt to. Last, you cannot find true blame for a driverless cars action when there is not anyone to blame. The driverless cars will not work in a society that is not ready for it.",
    "Making extracurricular activities mandatory for students is not a valid rule that should be enforced. I don't agree that all students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity, whether students graduate or not shouldn't be determined by an extracurricular activity that they may or may not have done most of the students already do an out of school activity students shouldn't be forced to do something that they dont want to do. Just because they didn't take part in the chess\u00a0club, or the yearbook committee doesn't mean that they should be held back. Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do. Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things. The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits. It does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter, if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity. What if you dont have time? Most students already do an after school\u00a0activity like sports, or a youth group. Some students even do multiple sports and still balance that with school. So for them to try and balance their after school activities, school, and now an extracurricular activity, it would be chaos. Students already go through enough stress with peer pressure, and their grades, and maybe just problems at home, so they shouldn't have to worry about this too. For example, maybe some students want to get a scholarship through playing a sport,and maybe their really good and actually have a chance at getting one. If you enforce that rule they would have to focus less on their sport and more on the extracurricular activity. Some students have trouble socializing with others. So maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too. Some students also enjoy their free time, time where they can do homework, be on their electronic devices, or just take a nap. So they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time. Students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something. I mean it is called extracurricular activity for a reason, because it's for extra credit, so it shouldn't be a mandatory thing that they have to do. Students graduating shouldn't be decided by if they did an extracurricular activity or not,and the students who already do after school activities don't have time for for extracurricular things,and students should not have to be pressured to do something if its not mandatory, so I don't agree that students should have to take part in an extracurricular activity.\n",
    "Did you know that car crash fatalities are the number one cause for teen deaths in the United States? In fact, according to TeenSafe. com, 11 teens die as a result of texting and driving each day. Distracted driving has now been universally labeled as an epidemic in America and a large quantity of distracted driving incidents stem from cell phone use. Cell Phones should not be eligible for use when handling a street motor vehicle. When people use cell phones, all of their focus is not directed toward driving. Whilst listening to music or conversations (like from a podcast or a call), drivers dedicated focus on the road decreases by 40%. This is a major reason as to why cell phone use leads to 1.6 million wrecks a year. Without being allowed to use cell phones while driving would make it so everyone is solely focused on driving and uses their full brain capacity to reduce the risk of crashes. Even without constant use of a cellular device whilst driving, it still has a hindrance on people's ability to view the road Our brains instinctively respond to the alerts our phones send us, making it nearly impossible to resist the temptation to do so. Aceable. com says that you are 1.4x as likely to crash when just simply reaching for your phone and 23x the risk when texting, which is 6 times the risk of when under the influence. If we can't handle not reaching for our phones, then it needs to be banned similarly to alcohol. Alcohol is made so that you are not allowed to travel with open containers. Cell Phones should be completely off and tucked away somewhere for you to retrieve them for when you are finished traveling. Your phone should not be on your person if you are controlling a vehicle to avoid the temptation. If you decide not to turn your phone off, you must pull over safely and steadily when you wish to answer a call that may be of importance Following these rules would drastically decrease both the risk of getting into wrecks and the number of annual fatalities that come from distracted driving.",
    "The author does not support his idea well that studiying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author talks about people being facinated with Venus, that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in proximity and features, and that it would be cool if humans were able to explore Venus What he does not talk about well is the why. Why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Here is a part of the artical where the author talks about why it would be cool to study Venus. \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,\"(paragraph 4). The author mentions humans being facinated with Venus and how the planet was once Earth-like. This information does help us see how it would be cool to visit Venus and it tells us some information about Venus. On the other hand the author doesn't give a solid reason for why studying Venus is worth it and despite the risks. \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors,\"(paragraph 8). The author does not tell us what the insight is that will be gained from exploring the planet. Also what does human curiosity leading us into other endeavors have to do with how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Their reason and support for studying Venus is weak. The author trys to use their own opinion to convince the readers that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. The author aslo doesn't give a sound explanation as to how the danger of heat can be overcome for enabling the trip to be successful \"Some simplified eclectronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions,\"(paragraph 7). The author explains that there is a material that can survive on Venus for a little while. A problem to this could be that the metal might actually not work on Venus because since no one has ever been ther how would they know exactly what it is going to be like. That is why they are going there in the first place to explore Venus They could have totally messed up on the calculations of surviving on the planet and it might be a failure The pros of this mission are far less important than the cons to this mission. If they succed then they can say they know what on Venus and can gain some information. If they fail then people can die, a load of money is gone because of the time, energy, and resorces put into the exploration are gone. The author does not support his idea well that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They only give a few reasons why the trip would be worthy. They use their own opinions as facts trying to pursuade the readers to agree with their ideas. They also don't fully explain how they can by pass the dangers involved with this exploration study on Venus. Since the author has used their opinion as facts and cannot explain without a doubt that this pursuit can be successful despite the dangers I have to say that they did not do well at supporting their idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

    "Cell phones should be able to be used at breaks and lunch periods. This is true because they aren't hurting anyone, they allow kids to call or text their parents if they needed something, they allow lonely people to play games on their phones if their friends weren't around. As long as it is only used at breaks It's not like we are in a class and a cell phone goes off and then the whole class is distracted from learning.\n Me and my friends take a trolley home sometimes, but i don't always get to take it because someone is already at school to pick me up. If i could use my phone at a break though I would be able to call my mom and ask her if i could take the trolley before she would have left. Or, what if a kid accidentally left a project or paper at home and it was due the next period. All he would have to do is call his mom or someone at home to come to the school and drop it off. As you can see, cell phones allow kids to contact their parents in times of need. Some times kid's friends might be absent and they might have no one to talk to. If they could use their phones they might be able to play games on their phone Another thing they could do is call friends or family members at other schools. So then they wont be so bored and they will have something to do. This is how cell phones allow lonely kids to be occupied. In conclusion, cell phones are a useful tool and should be allowed at lunches and breaks. This is because they don't hurt anyone, they allow kids to contact their parents if needed",
    "I believe that you should only have your phones out while you are at lunch and they should be off while teachers are talking i think this because kids do need something fun to do for lunch and also it could stop them from being bad in the class room. i think it will stop them from being bad in the class room because they would have had something to do and pay attention because they had so much fun at lunch. also i do not think they should have there phone out in class because that means that people will get distracted and the person with the phone out will not learn anything. But i do think that it is a good idea to have the phones out at lunch because they are not learning anything at lunch time they are only eating. so i do not see the big deal of eating and texting but i do see the big deal with texting in the classroom because that stops you from learning Also about phones off in the class room i think you should be able to keep them on but the sound all the way off so it does not beep or anything. but i think you should be able to have it on because if there was a fire and you needed to call your mom right away to pick you up then that is pretty important. so i do agree with the first one because how much harm can a kid do with texting and eating lunch. so you might think that it is a bad idea and go with what you want but i really do think that there will be no harm done if you allowed them to get there phones out for lunch. also if you let them come to lunch with phones they will be more willing to not take there phones out during class",
    "The usage of cell phones instantly grew after the introduction in the 1980s. One of the primary reasons they have grown in popularity is cell phones allow people to communicate from all over in a matter of seconds. Due to the fact cell phones are such a vital part of lives, phone use while driving has become a definite safety concern. Adults spend an average of 45 minutes a dav on social media. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration noted 1,830 motor vehicle accident fatalities for young drivers, according to teendriversource. org. Many of the accidents were from distracted cell phone use Cell phones should not be used in any capacity while operating a car for fear of distractions higher insurance rates increased accidents and fatalities.\n Cell phones being such an essential item in today's society, people find it hard to let go of cell phones while diving. Phone holders and Wifi have been added to many vehicles to enable hands free cell phone use while driving. Participating in any activity while driving, other than watching the road and their surroundings, creates distractions. Texdng, calling, reading tex ts, or sin1ply holding a phone to your ear can cause a momentary attention distraction. In a split second these distractions can cause a major accident. Phone usage is so dangerous because drivers are distracted with manual operation, visual reading, and cognitive processing (Bonner). Accidents are financially costly to all parties involved. Car insurance can double when accidents are caused by phone usage For drivers at fault in accidents, rates increased more than\n$500 (Moore). The number of accidents determine car insurance rates for the area. With more accidents due to cell phones, rates have increased overall. All drivers are paying in some way for the irresponsibility of distracted drivers. Many states have passed laws to prohibit cell phone use while operating a car. Using a cell phone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on U.S roads In the U.S., inappropriate phone use caused over one million car accidents (Edgar Snyder, n. a). Teen accidents with motor vehicle crashes involving fatalities were a result of distracted driving. When answering a text while driving, it takes your attention away for about five seconds. A great deal of things can happen in five seconds. Overcorrecting the car while on the phone has unfortunately been the cause of many fatalities. No conversation is worth human life It goes without saying that cell phone use in any capacity while operating a vehicle is dangerous and threatens safety. Statistics support the reasoning for restriction of use while operating a motor vehicle. Distractions, higher insurance rates, and increased accidents and fatalities prove why cell phone use should be forbidden.",
    "Hi i am Luke. I have some reasons why I think you should be a Seagoing Cowboy. When i first heard my friend ask me if i wanted to be a Seagoing Cowboy I did not know if I wanted to do it but once i found out what it was i thught it would be fun. When I got there and started doing what i was suppost to do I started enjoying it.\n A reason I did is because I knew I was doing the right thing by helping with there community and just helping them with some little things also. Another reason is that when I went their I got to explore the acropolis in Greece and it was beautiful I think you would like it to. I also got a ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy. I also went to china! It was very fun and so is being a Seagoing Cowboy I also learned alot from it like we dont have to worry if we are going to get what we want for breakfast because some people that are less fortunate dont even have Three meals a day. It was hard to take that in but it deffinetly changed my whole point of view in life. I hope that if you give being a Seagoing Cowboy a shot that it would change your point of view in life also. You should give it a try and see if you like it. If you do not like it you do not have to do it but if you do like it i suggest you do it more often, it is helping out and it is doing the right thing. So my point is that you should give being a Seagoing Cowboy a chance because it could defenitly make a change in this world. Thank you!",
    "\"We have to join a club?\" Generic_Name said shocked, \"Like, we have to?\". Generic_Name looked confused and slightly angry. \"Yes Generic_Name, you do have to join a club, it's a requirement for the new year.\" said Principal Generic_Name. Generic_Name looked down than looked back up at his principal, \"Great.\" Generic_Name said sarcastically. Generic_Name spent that school day looking around and asking about the different clubs the school offers. While Generic_Name was looking, one club caught his eye. The gaming club. When Generic_Name was out of school he always played video games, it was his favorite pass time! Since the gaming club was the only club that sounded remotely appealing to Generic_Name, he signed up. His first day in the club, he was skeptical, but he quickly realized the club was far better than he expected. 2 weeks passed since Generic_Name joined and he already made plenty of new friends and learned about many new games that he grew to love. Schools should make it a requirement for all students participate in a extracurricular activity it helps students meet new people and make new friends, it can introduce students to something they've overlooked or have never heard of before it can increase social activity among\u00a0students. having students join and participate in an extracurricular activity can help them meet new people and make new friends. Joining an extracurricular activity such as a club or a sports team can be very beneficial to students. Having students join clubs can help shy students talk to new people and make more friends. Even someone who is frequently talkative and already has a lot of friends can meet and talk to new people who share the same interests as them in the club. Having friends who share your interests is something that every student wants, and joining an extracurricular activity can help students achieve that. It was only Generic_Name's first day in the club when he met two people who would later become his best friends. \"Hello,\" said a voice Generic_Name has never heard, \"My name is Generic_Name.\". Generic_Name looked at Generic_Name and shook his hand, \"Hey Generic_Name, i'm Generic_Name. Nice too meet you\". The person standing behind Generic_Name introduced himself next. \"Sup Generic_Name. My name's Generic_Name, I'm Generic_Name's Friend.\" he said. \"Nice too meet you as well Generic_Name.\" Generic_Name replied. Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name quickly became good friends because of their similar interests. requiring students to join an extracurricular activity can introduce students to something they've overlooked in the past, or something completely new. Students have their interests, they either like something, or they don't. Something might not come off as interesting to them at first glance. They might only start to realize something is interesting to them when they take another look. If schools do an event that shows off each different club, students will get that \"second glance\" that they need. For example, my older brother wanted to join a club in high school. He looked through the website and found that nothing sounded interesting to him. He decided to look again, this time actually reading the descriptions of each club. He eventually found the art club. He read the description, thought it sounded interesting and signed up. ubs and sports are very social activities. If they're in a club, students are basically required to socialize with others. This for the most part is a very positive benefit, allowing students to talk to others who share similar interests with them. Students may even spend time outside the clubs with the people they've met. For example, my cousin Generic_Name's mom, forced Generic_Name to join a club. She said Generic_Name wasn't socializing enough and spent to much time time on his computer. Generic_Name asked around to find a club that was preferably easy. He eventually found the computer club which aligned\u00a0with his interests, and his want to spite my aunt by \"playing on computers\" in his club. Despite that my aunt got her wish and Generic_Name became more social outside of school with his new club.\nGeneric_Name had spent his entire 10th grade year in the gaming club. Now that summer was approaching for the first time in his life he felt sad about leaving during the summer. Generic_Name never thought by joining a club his perception about school would change this drastically. The next day Generic_Name and his club talked about meeting up over the summer, everyone was ecstatic about the idea. Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name all have met up before outside of the club before, but the entire club has never got together like this. School ended just as fast as it started and the day quickly approached when the club would get back together again. schools should make it so all students have to participate in an extracurricular activity such as a club or a sport because it helps students make new friends and build relationships, it can introduce students to something they've overlooked in the past, and it can increase social activity among students.

    "Today we will be talking about the story \"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.\" So sit back in your chair, and prepare to get lost your mind. Veiwer beware you might just learn somthing new. In this paragraph will be talking about the young man on his way to eroup Luke Bomberger. Some people say that it was dangerous but I say he did a heroic act by bring cattle and horses to war torn countries Such as he knew it was an opprotunity of a life time. That is supported by parts of the story were he may have to work but has fun in between his hard work. Like when in italy he visits such places like Crete or the Acropolis. There were also bad times like when he fell of that slipery ladder and broke some of his ribs in a storm and almost fell over board if it wasent for a small metal bar holding him in. For a second lets talk about the time he spent overseas We look at the fun he had in his nine adventures Such as when he first visted Greece. He went to the Acropolis, soon after he visited the Panama Canal. Those were just some of the places that he got to travel not includeing Venice or Crete or even China. In the end all you can say about Luke Bombriger is that he tried to help people. He was so selfless that even broken ribs couldnt stop him form doing whats right. There are only words that can discribe his charachter, selfless, kind harted. The number one thing you can call him this and simply this human.",
    "The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The electoral college process consist of the selection of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors wher they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Personally I believe that Electoral Colleges work because it would be a great process where students can work their way up to become a congressman, it would also look good on your reputation. It would be a great process where students can work their way up to become a congressman. Imagine all the wonderful things you can learn about congress and you can have your own personal experience. The electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requried to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in the Congressional delegation: one for each memeber in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for aslate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you live in Taxas, fpr instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democatic electors pludges to Mr. Kerry. It would look good on your reputation. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. I know your would wat that because that would be great, and really helpful. The presidential election is held every four yoears on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. After the presidential\u00a0 election, your governor prepares a \"Certificate of Ascertainment\" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official recors of the presidential election. The single best argument against the electoral college is what researchers call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system allows for much worse. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. ",
    "Summer is like a brainwash. Students seem to forget everything they learned in school that year over the summer. To try and combat this, many teachers assign summer projects so the students don't fall behind on any of their learning. Students are often upset by this, wanting their summer to be fun and stress free. Teacher designed projects are often long and tedious making them boring to do. The summer projects should be student-designed. Having the projects be student-designed allows for a greater range of creativity more control over how the project is completed, creates a better mindset for disgruntled students. \nAllowing for summer projects to be student designed makes for a greater range of creativity A greater range of creativity would encite students to finish their projects faster if they were given a wider range of mediums to work with instead of just paper and pencil, or a computer program. Even when it's not over the summer, being assigned a project where I can make a poster or create a diorama instead of writing a paper is already much more exciting to me because I'm given a bunch of different mediums to work with. I personally prefer creating something big and artsy to sitting down and churning out a paper within a set time frame. The process of creating something huge feel much more satisfying because I can visibly see when I am done. Completing a paper still has a feeling of satisfaction but the overall feeling is dulled because no creativity was released. A greater range of creativity also allows for a much more interesting presentation. A differentation of styles in projects makes the overall project much more interesting and increases the chances of students paying attention for longer during those presentations. \n Completion of the project is thought to be most important. Allowing students to control how the project is completed is much more student oriented A student oriented project should be more fun and less stressful as to not add anything more on top of an already heavy workload. Letting students decide how the project is presented and what the rubric should entail makes the students not only happier, but less stressed as a result. If the students can control what they want to do in the project or how the final product should be, it could help immensely with the overall students happiness and create a stronger student community. The mindset for summer is just fun, fun, fun. Adding a summer project dampens that mindset. It becomes a burden for students to deal with. No one wants to do schoolwork over the summer, summer is the time for fun! Allowing students to create a student designed project would create an overall better mindset towards how summer project are viewed. I know that I don't want to do school work over the summer. Giant math packets, books to read, papers to write, it's all so tedious and I always end up pushing it off til August, where I'm then rushing to get it all done in time for the start of school. If I were to be given a project that I could control, it would already seem so much better because I would be in full control over what I did for the project or how I approached a problem I encountered with it. It's important to keep a healthy mindset in school so you don't burn yourself out Summer is seen as a time to destress and have fun and creating a better mindset towards student project by making them student designed is extremely crucial to that. When I think of school projects, I think of teachers handing them out at the end of a quarter or towards the end of school to be completed over the summer. Projects are a way to either boost or bring down your grade, depending on how you do. Because of that effect on grades, important projects tend to stress students out. When students are given more control over a project it immediately takes stress off the student because they automatically control how their project is made and presented. Teacher designed projects are made to showcase how well teachers teach their students. If more students get a higher grade on a project, the credibility of that teacher goes up. They are viewed as a better teacher overall. While teacher designed projects might have more academic results, having projects be student-designed creates a wider range of creativity, control over how the project is executed, and makes a more postive mindset for students.

    "Asking for advice\u00a0is definitely the way to go in some situations. Many kids look up to adults as role models and for good advice. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by giving them different views on things. Advice is the best way for children to learn how to make good choices and not let anything bad possibly happen. Some examples would be going through body changes such as puberty. When kids go through puberty, a lot happens and they might get stressed out. So family and close friends of theirs will be there to give advice or anything the children need. Some teenagers need help from family or close friends on getting advice after going through a breakup. Going through breakups isnt easy and loved ones will always be there to help him or her. Some kids like to get advice from a teacher on how to prepare well for a test coming up. They do not want to fail so they make sure the teacher gives them some sort of extra practice. Teenagers that are getting ready to become an adult should get advice from both parents on life skills that they should know for when they do become an adult, so they won't be as stressed out. More examples would be if you know someone that is possibly at risk or in danger and you don't know what to do, you should go to a trusted adult and talk to them, so they can help make sure nothing bad will happen to that person. Getting opinions on certain situations helps so much more than trying to figure\u00a0it out\u00a0yourself. Adults, family members, and close friends will always be there to give advice to you whenever you need it, and it's important to get advice so you don't make a bad choice or mess something up. Never be scared to ask anyone for advice because they will just want to help you\u00a0and not make you feel ashamed or worthless. Different people have different thoughts on situations and\u00a0each input will help a lot. From all of these examples, that's why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.",
    "Just because the Seagoing Cowboys program seems old, it is still a good thing to join. The Seagoing Cowboys fit many people's needs. Our number one reason for this program is to do good deeds for other people in other countries. We help these people after wars, and when their towns are destroyed. Although I only helped take care of the animals that were boarded on the ship being sent over, I still benefitted to the people on the ship by doing work for them. It kept me busy. I watched the animals and and checked on them, and I also reported on how they were doing. I also had night shifts to check on the animals each hour. One night, however, I slipped on a ladder, and couldn't work for a few days because of racked ribs. Thankfully, I fell on a piece of metal, and it caught me from falling into the ocean. I am lucky to be alive! We don't work the whole time in the program, however. You would like what we get to do when we aren't working. We exlore and visit new, interesting places. We go to several different countries, and get to see how the people's culture, life style, and needs are different than ours. I had gotten a tour of a castle in Crete, visited China, Europe, and the Acropolis in Greece! Not only did we visit places, but we also had some freetime once in a while on board. We had baseball games, volleyball games, tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.\n If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program, it is beneficial to 18 year old men, or men older than 18. Why? It is because when you are drafted to the military services at age 18, the military will count this program as your serving. I had turned 18 while I was on board and before we had even arrived to Greece, and I knew I couldn't be in the program and military at once. Lucky for me, the military coutned it as my service. Lastly, if you have ever wanted to meet other nations, you should join this program. Up to 44 nations join together to comeplete the tasks of the Seagoing Cowboys Overall, I think that the Seagoing Cowboys are a very helpful, beneficial group of good people.",
    "People like me like to think what their choices are when people give advice. When I get advice from one person I have to ask another person just to see if they would give the same advice. I like to know that i have choices to pick from but thats it about me. People like me like to hear everyone opinions just to whats different about what we think. Sometimes we dont have that right advice to give ourselves so we hear what other people have to say. When people take advice from one person they dont know if they telling the best advice that is good for them so what we do is ask someone else just to see if we can get better advice from someone else. When you hear advice from just one person maybe you don't feel like that was the advice you could of got, so we ask different people what there advice would be to see if you have a better choice. We know that everyone is different\u00a0no one ever has the same advice but some people dont give the best advice and some people give great advice. A lot of people give different advice we will not think is correct or maybe we think its the best but sometimes we got to keep our choices open. Ex: when are mom give advice it may not be the best so you may ask your dad to see what he will say and he say something way different then what your mom said so now you like you dad advice more the your moms. There is nothing wrong with getting advice from 10 different people. some one may not like that advice that the person give them so what they do is ask some friends or mom an dad just to be able to think. Maybe you might come up with your own advice but dont think its the best so you hear other\u00a0people opinions. Having choices to run through\u00a0is always good cause you can can like like that advice someone give you but you know that might not be like best or you might not like it so ask people. When you have choices to go around you can make the best choice.",
    "I think you should let us students to bring our cell phones to school we are in a growing society and we all need to communicate. to begin with i consider all students must have a cell phone in order to text their class mate to ask about the home work from last night or just to have a briefly talk about the test in class that they are giving or just to let the students have more freedom. also texting is being more widely used than any other devise in earth like face book or twitter they are both being used to talk on the phones know every body has a phone i am right yes because technology has been growing rapidly and faster then ever know on days you don't see that device what was it called oh yea the beeper because it took so much time to call the one typing it in and for her to send the message to the other person beeper that has become obsolete. also phones have been one the worlds greatest inventions. in fact the on who created the first phone was Alexander gram bell and know look at the phones they even have GPS. they can take you to their destination with out problem is like the sexton that used triangulation to find your position in earth. but know they use seven GPS to know where you are and were are you going now they are more accurate they take anywhere any time any place. phones have develop allot know there even a hand free devise that you use that is not even a cord is just dangling from your ear and it its totally cool to have one i have one. so please principal with your rat honor please allowed phones for us to call each other. also hanks for taking your time and reading this thank you allot i hope you take my opinion in consideration ",
    "Humans have always been interested on exploring planets, countries depending on where you are going, islands, no matter the dangers or risks that can be present there. Then people talk and write about their experiences and what they discovered in there. Exploring Venus can be dangerous, interesting, and scary but excited at the same time.\n In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author says that it presents dangers study Venus, but is also a worthy pursuit Venus and Mars are one of the closet planets to Earth. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we had experience in our planet. \"Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun\".\"Beyond high pressure and heat , Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface\" But for some people it is still interesting to know more about Venus Astronomers are fascinated about Venus, for what is there and what was there long ago Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system\". Venus, long ago could be covered largely with oceans and had supported forms of life. \" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, montains, and craters\". So, that can be scary but still for some people is excited to know a a different planet. People already went to the Moon, Venus sometimes is te=he nearest option for a planetary visit despite Mars. Venus once was probabably covered by oceans and could have supported various forms of life. \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth\". In Venus the tempetures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.\" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth: such an envirionment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals\". But anyways NASA is working and having ideas for sending humans to study Venus.\" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers\". It is good that people propuse themselves challenge, and not be afraid of wanting to know more about the world and people should not be limited by its dangers and risks, or the thinking that you cannot do it. If you propuse something and you really want it, you can get it or at least try and work hard on it.",
    "I belive that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I believe that it is valuable because you can tell what a student is going through and how they really feel even if they are trying to hide it. In the article it states that \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" this could help teachers out a lot. If the computer can show that many students are bored or confused the teacher can see the results and help the students undersatnd more or just change the lesson plan and spend more time actually trying to help the studens instead of just making them understand something that they dont know how to do. It could also tell you if the students is going through a hard time in their life at the time. The author states in the article \"the software can even identify mixed emotions\" so if a student gets scanned on the computer and it shows they are sad you can ask them if they want to talk about anything, or you can just be there for them to make sure that they are ok, and they they get through whatever is going on safely and not by themselves. In conclusion thi is why i belive that this technology to read emotional expressions of student in a classroom is valuable.",
    "Luke was at his part time job when his friend Don came in and said (do you want to come on a cattle boat trip with me.) Luke knew it was a opportunity of a life time and couldn't say no. Luke was 18 before he arived in Greece which meant he could be drafted for military service.\nWhen the draft board learned he was on a cattle baot trip they said that he was able to keep going on the cattle boat trip. The cattle boat trip was an unbeleivable opportunity for a small towns boy like hime.\nLuke helped out on his aunt Katie's farm whch prepared him for hard work but not for the dangers at sea. Luke also found a way to have fun on board even on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.\nWhen Luke got home he was very grateful that he was able to go on the trip. To the cowboys it was an adventure but to Luke it was a opportunity to open up a whole new world. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host of intternational students and exchange visitors for many years.",
    "I believe that a B average would be a good thing to bring into sports. it will give them a harder drive to make good grades and do good in school Then again some of the teams best players may not be able to make a B average. this will make teams much small and sports not near as exciting or fun for the spectators who watch these games. very many parents my not be happy about their child not being able to play on a team, but school should be more important to these parents who's kids are not achieving a B average. \n The main reason why i think students should have to have a B average before being able to play sports is that school is the most important thing in someone's life. Even if some kids are not making that B if they love e the sport they play enough they will make that b average no matter what. This will make students strive harder in school but also in sports because they know that they are right on the edge of a C average that will also make the strive harder in whatever sport you may play. \n On the other hand their will be many mad students and parents because that student is not able to play the sport that he or she may love. and also the coaches may get mad too because one of his or her best plays may not be making the grades that he or she needs to make to play this sport. This would probably only happen for a couple of years or sport seasons but after awhile everything would be back to normal and it would be just like anything else in the world and people would begin to grow to the B average rule that the principle has. I think in the end that this would be a good thing because it would make students want to try harder in school if they really like a sport and wanted to bring their grade up to be able to play this sport. Then again i think every school should have to have this rule because it would be unfair to one team if the other team did not have the players they wanted because of this rule. I think you could take this rule and put it into school systems and see improvement all over the state then maybe all over the country. So yes i think that even though it would cause a lot of trouble it would be a good thing to raise grades all over the country. ",
    "When people ask for advice why do they sometimes ask many people? In my opinion i think that asking more than one person can help you get more information than just asking one person. By asking many people it can get you more advice on the subject and help you know more about what your asking about. Getting more opinions can help you because it can get you more advice and by getting more advice helps the person asking know more. What does it help by asking more than one person it can get you get you more advice just in case\u00a0you did not know. People like to ask other because the one that they are asking might know more than if you where to not ask Not knowing what you want to know can effect you because if you will need to know it. Asking others helps you because it can make what ever your wanting to know easier by getting help and asking. Why do they like to get multiple opinions on what their asking and not just asking one person for their opinion. People ask for many others opinions so that they can make sure there right and not wrong because if you ask for one persons opinion they might be wrong. The benefits of asking multiple people are you ca learn more than you wanted and know exactly what you needed to know. So in conclusion is better to ask multiple people rather than just one person because it can get you to know more so asking more than one person is a good thing to do so next time you want to know something ask multiple people rather than one.\u00a0\u00a0 ",
    "imagine you spend your all your schooling days at home and enjoy\u00a0sleeping in, eating what ever lunch you want on your own time,and anytime your doing your work you could also be watching TV, but then suddenly you realize \" wow my teens went by so fast\" and now you have to get a real job and now you have to have a to wake up on time, and you dont have very many friends and you feel as if you wasted your teens. although\u00a0you might have anxiety or stress,you should try to go to school to the best of your abilities. i believe all should go to normal school instead of online school because, you would not get good people skills going to school is a helpful learning place where you learn life lessons and you would not get the experience that is school.\n first of all, you would not have good people skills. going to school kinda nurses you into society, were it teaches you to make friends and have your own little click, doing your own thing, this is even truer in high school were there are more students, i also believe it gives you the ability to adapt, weather that be to a new place\u00a0or a friend changing or just getting into trends or memes. when going for a job you have to be able to make friends or at least present your self in a confident manner, if not that could give others the ability to walk all over you and or make fun of you, this sometimes still happens anyways but have confidants in your self or friends to help will make it easier and make you feel better about your self, this will also help with job interviews and life altercations, these are just some things i think life skills will help with.\n second of all, going to school is a helpful learning place where you will learn life lessons if you spend all you time on a computer taking courses you could miss a lot\u00a0of things or not take in the information because your more of a hands on learner, like say you want to be a welder you take the OSHA test and other courses but when you go done to get a job youve never welded before. learning math, English, science, and others are not the only things you can learn in school, you can figure out what you want to do in life, or develop skills that you did you would not have anywhere else, like take me for example i wanted to be in the army but now i want to weld and i'm\u00a0decent at art and thinking about being a tattoo artist. last of all, you would miss the experience that is school, because your to busy at home being lazy at home getting fat i understand school can be a scary place, i should know i'm\u00a0a 10th grader i've been going awhile, i've handled\u00a0bullies, losing friends getting new ones enjoying fun activities, grueling over stupid Sols that make me want to scream and stress me out, and learning to talk to girls, still working on that last one, but all the stress, anxiety bullies girl trouble, losing friend, and getting knew ones, are all apart of life, and its not easy but life is not easy as well, and going to school is getting you ready for life. school is an experience that i think all should do, i'm not saying i enjoy it but i'm thankful for it. in conclusion, i think all should go to school instead of learning from a computer screen at home, anxiety, stress are things you most battle to overcome and make friend to help you out in your time of need or just to talk to, and developing people skills. you can learn so many life lessons from school such as a good schedule\u00a0to stay on track what you wanna do in life, and develop\u00a0knew skills and talents, and possibly some hobbies too. you would miss the experience that is school and waste your teens, you know most people that are out of school say enjoy it while you still can, or i wish i was\u00a0back in school because becoming an adult is scary and you can never fully be prepared for it, so enjoy being a kid going to school hanging with friend and leaning along the way because it will end soon, and its free. and those are the main reasons why i think you should go to school instead of learning at home from a computer.\u00a0",
    "I have heard you are considering the possibility of banning the use of cell phones from school. Yes cell phones at times can be distracting but at other times cell phones can be a help to student and faculty. If a student is out of class and gets into any sort of trouble they could make a call with the click of a button. Yet if they don't have their phones students could get hurt and not be able to make a call resulting in many different types of crisis. Also with the technology that we have today students could do useful things on their phones. For example if the lost something they could send out messages saying they would give a reward if someone saw it. This would be much more efficient then a child walking around school asking every student in sight. To insure the fact the fact that students do not use cell phones during learning hours of school you could have teachers collect cell phones at the beginning of class. If the students drop their phones off as they walk into class it may be a very efficient way to ensure children do not have phones in class. Another way you can be sure that the use of phones is not happening during learning hours is if you have students put their phones onto the corner of their desk. This way its in your sight and you know that cell phones are not being used. You may think what if students use their phones when the teacher turns around? Students phones must be turned off during class. If a teacher turns around for a minute to write something on a board, any student would know that he or she would not be able to turn on their phones and finish texting all by the time the teacher turns around they would simply get caught. This makes the method of leaving the cell phones on the corner of the desk another good idea. phones should be permitted during school hours when children are not learning. There are many techniques to ensure that phones are not in use during learning hours and above are just the most simple. The use of phones could save a life or just be very useful in case of any emergencies. Cell phones are a part of society today and that should be accepted",

    "In today's world, students are filled with many emotions, some too difficult for even parents to decode. The rollercoaster of feelings that a teenager endures in a day is confusing and complex. But with newly found technology, it may be easier now for the emotions of students' to be understood and assisted, if needed. The revolutionary Facial Action Coding System allows computers to scan and analyze the feelings of a human, alive or painted, and is a very valuable tool to comprehend student's emotional expressions. This highly advanced technology is able to serve a multitiude of purposes that will foster an improved learning environment for students. Because of this new and itelligent technology, doctors and others are able to read emotions of people in a way never previously possible. This brilliant computer \"constructs a 3-D computer model of the face\" (3). including all major muscles. With the ability to do so, this computer scans and creates a human face and, based on the position of the muscles, is able to determine the distribution of emotions felt at that moment by a person. Tested with the Mona Lisa, this model \"can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face\" (4). By comparing the chosen face against an emotionless one, this advanced techonology allows the ability to use muscle positions to analyze the feelings of a person The ingenuity of the computers provide the resources and ability to decode complex human emotions and, in turn, will be able to be utilized in methods that will add to the betterment of society. The Facial Action Coding System will foster a more positive learning environment for students by adapting their online experience to their emotions. If implemented in daily computers, this technology will revolutionize the environemnt and usage of the Internet. Because this technology can map emotions, \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different\" (6). With the implementation of this technology, students will be able to influence which advertisements and pages appear on their screen. This will reduce their impatience on the computer, and actually stay focused on the task at hand, rather than getting frustrated and walking away. With the ability to control the pages on their computer screen, students will feel empowered and influential, giving them confidence and increasing their work ethic. With an increased work ethic, students will remain productive and efficient with their time and materials. The content of the student's lesson can also be adapted based on their emotional behavior. Dr Huang, the innovator of this technology, describes that at school, \"'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\" By allowing the computer to customize the lesson, students will stay more engaged, as the content they are learning is one that they enjoy. Students will find pleasure in learning the subjects that interest them while also learning about other less-interesting subjects in a more captivating manner. The innovative technology serves to better a student's learning environment, keeping them engaged and interested in the content. Schools will notice increased success rates and knowledgable students. By providing students with the chance to customize the method in which they learn, school will be more enjoyable and students will stay committed to their education. The emotion-analyzing software gives students this chance and will greatly impact the way they learn and the committment to their education. The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning. Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn. The development of a desire to learn is crucial for school-aged children so that in the future, they will continue on to further educate themselves and expand their knowledge. This facial\n-analysis technology provides schools with the ability to create a captivating learning environment for students that will motivate them to stay committed to their education and reach their goals. While this new technology provides a bounty of benefits to many, assisting students in the achievement of their hopes and dreams holds the most value. ",
    "I believe that taking classes from home would have some benefits that are positive and negative more positive though than actually attending school I think that taking classes from home would allow you to have a better sleep schedule since classes usually start later around like 10, When at school it's way more difficult to get that full 8 or 9 hours of sleep because your either up late night studying for test or completing all the homework that some of these teachers give out. The typical 8-2 school days can also be very draining when you don't have the proper sleeping hours but if your classes would start later that would allow you to fully recharge your battery and wake up refresh also working in the comfort of your own bed would make you feel more relaxed and less tired and falling asleep lie most kids do in class. taking classes from home would lessen your social activity and there are just some things that only school can offer. The social aspect of school is a big reason and if you take online classes you''ll be missing that interaction with your peers,Which isn't exactly a good thing you are gonna feel more isolated and kinda lonely in a way not seeing your friends that you typically have classes with would have a toll on your mental state because sometimes the only reason kids come to school or attend school is to see your all your friends and even the ones you don't see outside of school. There just some benefits that only school can offer like electives you can't take most electives online like gourmet foods and advanced PE so at the same time school does have some elements too it that set you up for the real world in a way. Lastly I believe that online courses would just be a better way to teach kids because in most cases the classroom environment is just too much and to overwhelming sometimes early in the morning and in general,I think that working from the comfort of your home would allow you to be more comfortable to ask questions that you usually wouldn't ask in a classroom and you would be more focus since it isn't the pressure being with 29 other students that may get it quicker than you do. When your typically in class and your working on an assignment your teacher is usually going around helping everyone well most kids need a 1 on 1 with just you and the teacher and you normally can't get that so I believe that online courses would give you that 1 on 1 feel and that honestly can make an F turn into an A in some cases, In most colleges though your gonna be in a big classroom withe even more kids so I do think school does get you used to that kinda feel so it isn't all bad with the classroom environment. I also wanna say that sometimes the pacing of some classes can just be too much with quizzes and test every other class and all that studying but in that online class it's gonna feel better since it's a smaller classroom and you feel like there just cramping information into your brain. In conclusion I believe that home learning is better overall wise but that school does have it's benefits too and that I feel like home learning would kinda make you lazier in a way and that school leaning sets you up for the future more bu at the same time home learning would be way more efficient academic wise since your typically more isolated from your friends and can focus.",
    "I'm a scientist at NASA and I know that the face is just a natural landform. I have plenty of reasons why that is, and why it wouldn't be an alien. Yes, the face on Mars has become a pop icon, but that doesn't mean people could just assume it's an alien. NASA has plenty information and data for why it's just a natural landform. My first reason is that NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The picture noted a huge rock formation which seemed to be a human head that had eyes, nose, and mouth. You just have to think about it, those characteristics are obvious. I mean yes, it was found in Mars, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been a human. People just have to think more into the possible and not the impossible, because everything is possible.\n My second reason is that they photographed the face. Other scientists at NASA saw that it clearly looked like a human head. My third reason is that they even snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, it clearly revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This is why I, as a scientist at NASA think it's a natural landform and not an alien . these three reasons I have should make people think about it again and decide it's officially a human head. Those who believe it's an alien, should believe more in miracles. Anything could happen in Mars or any other place around the planet. This is only my opinion, but it sure makes me feel like I'm right about my thinking.",
    "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. As driverless cars are becoming a new deveoping technology, it's best to ask yourself, \"Are driverless cars really a necessity?\" The answer is, no, they are not a necessity for many reasons. We should not continue to develope driverless cars driverless cars are not completely driverless, the car would need a new built-in entertainment system to put inside of the car and if something were to go wrong with the car, who is to blame for this? When you hear the words, \"driverless car\" what comes to mind? Perhaps, you think of a car that can take you anywhere, and young teens the age of thirteen not needing an adult to drive them to a desired destination. However, driverless cars are not 100% driverless. In the article, the cars are said to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, because of this an alert driver is said to still be required. People are still needed to be able to navigate through work zones and around accidents. Manufacturers are still working on creating new ways to alert the driver when human skills are needed, but it is no secret that this will continue to cost money.\n Another reason why we should not have driverless cars, is because to have them, companies think a built-in entertainment system should be created, installed and required inside of all driverless vehicals. Today, we already have vehicals that contain a television inside for the passengers who occupy the back seats, to help keeped them entertained. This new entertainment system is said to shut off when the car needs the driver to take over and will not be available to a driver who is texting or using their phone in any way. However, putting in an entertainment system would still be considered a distraction, just the same as if someone were to be using their phone, and the article states drivers will need to remain alert, but they can not remain alert with an entertainment system. \nFinally, we should not have driverless cars because, if an accident were to occure, or if something fails, who is to bame for this issue? There are situations where we would not know who to blame, the driver or the manufacturer. We could blame the driver, stating that they should have been paying attention and been alert to stop the accident before it occured. However, we could also blame the car's manufacturer, because they were supposed to build the car and make sure it was not able to fail in the first place.\n As you can see, driverless cars could bring more trouble to us than we realize. They are not a necessity, we do not need to use driverless cars as our dominant way of transportation. The article states many positives and negatives aspects of the development of driverless cars. However, we should not continue to develope these cars because; driverless cars are not completely driverless, the car would need a new built-in entertainment system to put inside the car, and if something were to go wrong with the car, who is to blame for this?",
    "Venus is the second planet from the sun and the closest planet to Earth, in terms of density and size. Studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers if anything would happen to Earth it would be the nearest option for a planetary visit, we would learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, Venus is like Earth in multiple ways like being able to support life. \n If anything would ever happen to Earth, Venus would be our closet option for a planetary visit In paragraph two the text states,\"Earth, Venus,and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.\" This piece of text from the passage shows that if anything were to happen to Earth, Venus would be our closet option for a planetary visit because Venus is one of our planetary neighbors and closet to Earth at times. Secondly, we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions. In paragraph three the text illustrates,\"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" This piece of text from paragraph three shows that we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about the plant's harsh conditions and we would be able to see what materials could or couldn't work in such extreme heat. Finally, Venus is the planet that is most like Earth and use to have to ability to support life. In paragraph four the passage states,\"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" This piece of text from paragraph four shows that Venus is the planet most like Earth and had the ability to support life because it use to be covered in oceans. In summary, we should continue studying the planet Venus despite the dangers because if anything were to happen to our planet, Earth, Venus would be the closest planet we could go to, we could learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, and because Venus is most like Earth and had the ability to support life. Furthering our research on Venus can only benefit us, so lets stop worrying about the dangers and get out and explore our planetary neighbor. ",
    "In the story the aurther is describing why Venus is the 2nd Earth and there coomon and there diffrents and what would be the best matterial to use for the Vehicle Witch Nasa is working with some simplified electrons made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for 3 weeks in such conditions . Then Nasa also has a nother project were they are looking to work with the old technology called mechanical computers werefirst envisioned in the 1800's and played a inportant part in the 1940s during the World war ll. But the reason for the old tecnolagy is because if we were to have a cell phone on Venus is because it would melt because of the acid or heat capable of meting tin. You all so have people striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value ,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself , but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimedating endeavors.

    "The Face is just a natural landform. It happened 25 years ago. You can say its from aliens but it is not an alien! Iv'e seen pictures of Face. From reshearch only robots walked on Mars. Aliens are not even real. There are camras om thoes robots so they would know if they seen anything. Have you ever got a warning that an alien invation was about to occur? I think that some dust and rocks made this shape occur. Scientist have thier studies. My question is how did this alien form this pop up form. If u say it was a alien does it live under the dust. I don't think so,because it adventually is going to die. This is nonsense to belive that aliens walked on Mars and formed a type of shape. It is just a natural form. Why do you think this is an alien. One reason they would is because of it's shape. Do you have any evidence to prove to that this is an aliens shape. They probably would say no,because I do not see any antenas. That is a big hint to tell if that was an alien or not.\nWere's the body all you can see is a face so why assum it's an alien. Perfect good sense would tell you aliens aren't real. It's just a from that was created by natual resources on the planet. Use your research and don't go believing anything crazy. Such,as aliens living on Mars with just a head. I mean use common sense. What do you physically see on an alien. A big head,antena's,body,and wierd looking feet. This is not an alien people it is just a from that was created by natural resources. So don't go believing nothing foolish that we have aliens roaming different planets. Tust in NASA the greatest of all. Don't believe anyone who isn't and professional lke use. Nor trust a person with fause information,because they will have your mind,and you worried. ",
    "Do you think attending class online from home will benefit you and your studies? My sister took a class online that was required for her to graduate. She rushed through it and it was a huge waste of time. Therefore she didn't gain any knowledge. It would've been more beneficial if she took the class in school with a teacher in the same room as her with more instruction. Attending a class online at home can prevent you learning your social skills participating with hands on work, learning time management skills. School is a very important part to peoples life. Not only the learning aspect is important, but also the social aspect. You meet new people,not only in the beginning but also at the very end. You form relationships with others and get to make so many memories. I met my best friend in first grade and she is still my best friend. Her name is Generic_Name. She has introduced me to so many other people and has got me out of my comfort zone. My favorite part about the friendship is the memories we have made, the trust we gained, and the respect we have for each other. She has made me a better person and has opened up my eyes to be able to accept others no matter what they look like or how they feel on the inside. Some may argue that you can make a best friend with the people you go to church with, however you don't necessarily get to see them everyday which can lead to not communicating to them and loosing the bond you have with that person. I have made so many other friends through my Abby and we have such a strong bond with all of us its hard to break. I get so exited to wake up early and go to school just see my best friends, which always makes my day better. If I were to attend class online I wouldn't be the person I am today. Participating with hands on work and instructions by a teacher is important to students learning abilities. Their job as a teacher is to inform you about the information your presented with, and be able explain it to you the best way possible. Therefore, you can retain it and be able to apply it when it comes into play. I was in my 7th grade science class on a Monday. The week before I took a test on the biology of a spider. I didn't learn anything about it because I was sick and wasn't present in the class for the lesson and instruction given by my teacher. I missed a whole week and in the week my teacher gave out ways to help remember the information about the spiders life. I struggled so much on the test and didn't perform well. My teacher gave me the opportunity to retake it. I stayed after school and took notes while she presented me with details and ways to remember the steps of the spiders biology. That night I went home and re wrote my notes out until I can remember all the information she taught me. I took the test. Later, I found out I scored perfect on it. Im a visual learner and have to be present in class to be able to comprehend what I learn. I have to write everything down or drawl it out so my brain will be able to remember the information. If I don't remember the information on a specific test I have coming up, I can go back into my notes I wrote and re-write it out so I see the words again and again which helps my brain remember it better.\n Some may argue that, getting instruction by teachers is a waste of time, however it helps students find clarity in the information they are presented with, which they are required to learn and know it. Its harder to learn over a screen and be able to retain the information that is just presented to you without explanation. \nBeing able to managing your time with school work now is a very important tool you will also need for later in life. Being on top\u00a0of your school work means being able to complete it and turning it in on time. My friend attended school online from 1st-8th grade. When she got to high school she didn't know how much time she should give her self to get all her work done. She struggled with it and ended up failing all her classes her first 2 years of high school. She was so distracted by other things while she was doing her work, likewise, she never completed the work that she needed to get done and ended up not turning the work in. The summer going into her junior year she was depressed but also was very stressed. She ended up committing suicide and it was very hard for me as well as a lot of people to comprehend. A lot of students have a hard time with this task because you have to plan it out and go step by step through the process, but also giving your self enough extra time just in case\u00a0you dont get it done within that period of time. Its a hard task to map out due to peoples distractions happening internally or externally in their lives.\u00a0 Some may argue that you would dont need to manage your time because it won't effect your school life however, managing\u00a0your time is such a helpful tool that will help you become a successful person not only in your academic life but also your work life when your older. With attending classes online could prevent you from learning how to manage your work and can significantly effect your mental health. Its important for you to attend class in a school environment for you to get the best education. It can also help set you up to be successful, become the best person you can be, and to learn tools that can help you later in life. In the past, students haven't obtained much information while attending online class and puts them below average. That effects their life in a negative way and adds a lot of stress\u00a0into their lives. Students could be more involved with work and enjoy school if they attended school on a regular. If\u00a0we get ride of students attending online classes it will help students become a more out going person, learn the\u00a0task that will help their life be more successful, and teach them the best way they learn.\u00a0",
    "School is very stressful for many people. The homework piles on, the deadlines are to soon and to top it all off: there are tests and quizzes no one seems to remember. So to releive that stress in a way, there are online course options. But are online courses, classes from home, really that helpful? Better? Yes school is stressful, but many focus better at school than at home. At home I have a cat who yells at me, demanding for attention all the time. Then there is my dad who won't stop bothering me when he gets home. Finally, my attention span is one of a goldfish due to my phone just sitting there, waiting, beconning me to get lost in the world of the internet. But at school I dont't have all of those distractions. I'm kept busy and stay focused due to the working environment. One things schools teach better in person than online is teamwork. There are group projects and the students have to team up with people, either friends or strangers. In the projects we plan what we want to do, distribute the work and communicate. Being able to work with people on a team is an important aspect to learn before heading into the workforce. That is something you can't do when you are at home and an only child. \nDespite all of the stress school poses, it is very beneficial. Teamwork and focus are much better in a working environment. The stress of what happens at home forgotten. After all, home is either more stressful or distracting.",
    "Have you ever become ill during school days? Perhaps you felt anxious to go to school? Even wanting to learn at home than school itself? If you answered yes to any of these questions than distance learning would be most beneficial\u00a0for you. Distance learning is now an option for some schools for students to attend classes from home by the form of online or video conferencing. Simply imagine being able to partake in your education at the luxury of your home. Distance learning would be beneficial to students who are rather sick, socially anxious, and eager to learn as they will be able to attend classes at home with no harm. If you are ever feeling ill, you most definitely do not want to attend school as you are not feeling well and you could cause your fellow peers to become ill as well. When you do not attend school, however, you are missing out on a lot of quality learning. You may certainly be able to pick up the assignments you had in class, but doing them on your own may prove to be rather difficult. Thanks to distance learning, you are now able to attend classes that may support you in your education in a lot of different ways compared to not having any learning at all. When you learn at home when you are ill you do not have to worry about causing harm to your peers and your humble abode is a place where you can feel safe and comfortable. Illness can be many different things but no matter what it is it may be better for you to stay at home. In fact, you are most likely to be better supported at home as you can consume whatever food or medicine you need to make yourself feel better while learning something that will benefit you. I can recall many times when I was ill and I just sat at home doing nothing when I could actually be doing something through distance learning. The vast majority of individuals can agree that something is better than nothing. Social anxiety is rather common among\u00a0students, especially with teenagers across the country. Sometimes you just do not have the mentality to communicate with your peers effectively or you want to be alone due to other factors that may be causing your social anxiety. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of resources for these students to access or they are simply too scared to access them. Personally, I have felt this in days where I did not want to go to school at all due to bullying, peer pressure, and more. Students who feel anxious when going to school are typically fine in every other regard. With distance learning, these students are truly able to take the great opportunity of attending classes at home. Your education should not be at stake due to social anxiety, and this option changes that for the better. Those eager students that are academically successful may find this opportunity to be quite useful as well. You see, it is quite possible for students to attend their classes both at school and at home. This is beneficial to those who seek to advance within their path to graduation. For example, I did something similar with Virtual Loudoun, a program that allows you to take courses online for many reasons, one of them being to advance at an accelerated rate. There is also the high possibility that students may find their classes at school going to slow or being too easy. Through distance learning, you are able to work at your own pace as there is not a group of students needing to be helped or you are waiting on to continue a lesson. It is truthfully a marvelous thing for schools to offer such an excellent option to students who may need it or simply wish to have those great benefits. Whether you are ill, have social anxiety, or simply wanting to learn more, distance learning is beneficial towards you and many other groups. It is a shame that many schools do not offer distance learning as they are doing a disservice by not allowing students to have these benefits that other schools are offering. Students should make their voices be heard and call for schools who do not offer distance learning to immediately offer the option due to its great benefits. There is no doubt in my mind that any student body would not want this option being available to them. You should also call for schools to offer this as an option, as anyone can request for it to happen. If you don't, you are letting all of these great benefits that should be offered not exist to students that genuinely need them. Take the time to stand for what you need, it will only take you minutes to grant you hours of quality education.",
    "Personally i agree with the principals decision to have all the students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Depending on the activity chosen you could have a lot of fun doing these activities can help you relax and focus and help for a long term like trying to get a job or giving a better look to your self these activities could be dancing, playing an instrument or simply reading. The activities are designed so that you could be as calm and focused as possible. The reason that these activities that i stated maybe relaxing to most students is the fact that it could help them go into their own world and escape what could possibly be going on in their life. . for instance doing the school council or maybe helping a teacher could be fun depending on said students interests. But then there are the students whom find playing a sport witch is great too! It can help keep them active and feeling good. these activities will show up\u00a0on your job application and possibly your resame\u00a0in the future. Another way it could help in the future is that it could help by giving you skills that others might not have therefor, giving you the one up on getting that position in the job field they\u00a0would like to go in. I feel like the principal did this so that we could succeed\u00a0in life and say that al the students he\\she had had can and will succeed with flying stars. these activities could help us relax and focus more so that we could do well in and out of school. they can allow us to have fun in what we are doing. also,they could help us do well in the future giving us the skills that we could\u00a0use to be able to succeed in life and school so that we can live well.",
    "Many schools offer a variety of extracurricular activities that students can participate in. Although many students are recognized for all of the activities they do, some of their fellow students do not participate in any. There are many excuses children and teens come up with as to why they can't participate, but there are a couple logical reasons that support their case. If a principal made every student engage in an extracurricular activity, I would disagree. I do not think students should be forced to do certain activities they may not have the money to participate, they may be shy and performing in a sport or club is out of their comfort zone, they may not have enough time. If you are involved in sports there are many expenses that come with the honor. You have to buy the right shoes and clothes to practice in, but that's not all. Getting training lessons for the activity can be very expensive and a hard task to achieve. Also, their parents might want to use the money for other things that are important to them like a family vacation, or eating out. Lastly, they may be participating in an activity out of school that is expensive, and having to pay for both a school activity, and after school activity can be difficult. if it is your first time doing so, it can be very nerve-racking. Many teens know what they would have to experience if they participated, and after thinking about the hardships, they might decide to nothing at all. They may have an older sibling or friend to help them, but many students do not. Having a friend participate in the sport or club with you can be a great advantage, but some teens do not get that advantage. So forcing them to participate in an activity where they have no one to talk to during practice or to cheer them on, can make the activity seem boring. Some parents work late so finding a ride home or getting everything prepared for the activity can be hard. Also, a lot of students work on homework after school, if they played a sport or participated in a club, they may not have enough time to accomplish their studies, which in my opinion is the most important task of all. Students may not manage their time wisely. Finishing homework, participating in an activity, and still having a little free time at the end of the day is a lot to juggle. Without unlimited time on your hands, he or she may feel overwhelmed and stressed, which can lead to bigger problems. although I would respect the principal's ultimate decision, I disagree with her statement. Students should not have to be involved in an extracurricular activity. They should be able to choose if they want to participate in an activity. Ultimately, the students choice should be prioritized, because they know their own strengths, and there are a couple reasons to support my claim. The student may not have the money to do so, it may be out of their comfort zone, and lastly they may not have enough time, and forcing them to participate in an activity would bring stress onto their shoulders. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ",
    "When you have to make a choice in a situation you don't feel confident in the situation you will ask for advice; logically speaking, the more advice you get, the better your decision will be. place of discomfort bias lacking the confidence. This can apply in scenarios of where the decision maker is in a place of discomfort. Being selected by yourself alone can be stressful enough, but when you must make a decision about a topic you may be uncomfortable with the end results can be deafening. The amount of pressure that would be placed on that person's shoulders alone could be extremely hurtful, and if they aren't even comfortable with the topic in the beginning than they just couldn't make a clear choice\nBut when they are gifted compassion and advice, they will be able to make a choice that was not created through a state of panic but a state of calm.\n the decision maker has thoughts of bias. A biased opinion would be one that was created out of personal thoughts alone without further research, and to have those sources in order to make a decision that will effect others who disagree with it.\nWhen two different opinions are met, they will most likely either fight for their opinion, or accept that other people are allowed to have separate opinions about certain things. A biased person will not be able to do that without help. As long as there is bias, there will be a strong lining of stubbornness that will need to be broken down by facts and reasoning. The advice given by others will eventually do so, and then the decision maker will be able to present a fair, just, and unbiased choice. lacking confidence in themselves to making the possibly life-effecting choice. The kind of things that may be racing though a their heads would make it unbearable to decade what to do, you must have full confidence in order to make a choice that is set in stone.\nWhen you ask advice, you ask from different point of view, one that has full confidence in themselves in order to give you an honest answer. The only to learn is through experience, therefore, the decision maker figure out on their own how to gain confidence by listening to someone who has confidence and is giving them advice. the best way to make a fair decision is seeking multiple opinions from others in order to make the better choice.\nThrough advice, people who do not feel comfortable in the situation they are in will be able to give an answer that will be worth it; people of bias will be able to see past their personal views and give an equal answer; People who are not confident enough in themselves to make an exact answer will be able to learn and use those moments of submissiveness into teaching moments. Everyone deserves to make a choice, but there are always some people who need some help discovering it.\u00a0",
    "People ask for advice and feedback almost everyday. It could be advice regarding fashion, education, or artistic feedback. For example, imagine a student finishing a project she's been working on for quite awhile. Before turning the assignment in, this student will most likely ask her peers for their opinions on it. However, notice how she won't ask one single person, rather multiple people for feedback. Seeking multiple opinions and advice can help someone make better decisions understanding and seeing different perspectives on the subject, receiving new ideas they previously have never thought of. Asking a single person for his opinion will only result in one perspective of the topic . If people were to ask and receive only one response, the outcome becomes very limited and may not connect with a large audience. In order for it to apply to the audience, everyone would have to have the exact same thought process and opinions as the person the author asked; which is very unlikely. If someone wishes to connect with a variety of people, in this case a larger audience, they must have an understanding of many perspective and points of view. This way the outcome will apply to more people with different thoughts and opinions. When someone gives feedback, it's usually based off of the original idea that was given. However, there are scenarios where the advice given provides a brand new idea regarding the topic Asking more than one person for advice and feedback allows a person to suggest ideas and concepts one may never have thought of. To put into context, a student asks her peer for feedback regarding her art project. While most of her friends give feedback and opinions that relate to her project, one of her friends gives advice that suggests a new idea to add onto her original project. Not only does the student know how to strengthen what she has already made, she can now add a new element that benefits her assignment. \n Seeking multiple opinions and advice can be beneficial to someone because it can provide new ideas that previously have never been thought of, and help understand different perspectives on the topic. It's always important to ask for assistance and feedback when you need it. Because receiving that constructive criticism and working with it reassures the outcome is successful and applies to a larger audience. Overall, asking peers for their opinions can be an eye opener, and refresh one's mind in order to get their point across a variety of people. The more feedback one receives, the stronger the outcome becomes.\u00a0 ",
    "Studying Venus has the good and the bad. You find out so much about your planet and others. Like whybdonthey call Venus an \"Evening Star\" when its actually a planet. With Venus being provern a very challenging place to examine, ist hard to find out more abiut it. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite that dangers.\n One of the big dangers studying Venus is the temperature Venus is the hottes planet in our solar system. The planets temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than then on our planet. The conditions are way more extreme then what we've encounter on Earth. In addition to the heat there's erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. We could be living on Venus. Venus has the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus used to be covered with oceans that could've supported various forms of life. Even today Venus has rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus is an opttion for a planetary visit. There are solutions for the temperature. NASA's solution is to let scientist float above the fray. A vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape. It would be like airplanes flying over storms, but in this case its a blimp-like vehicle flying over the 800 degree surface. The vehicle would be thirty-plus miles above the surface. Solar power would be plentful anc radiation would not exceed Earth levels, survivable but not easy conditions. Trying to meet the challenge by Venus has value. Human curiosity will most likely lead us to many intimidating endeavors. With the dangers studing Venus, helps us incase we need to move to another planet. Studying Venus is dangerous but, it has its perks. ",
    "Everyday people die in car accidents, because they use their cell phones while driving. According to research, cell phones are leading factors to most car accidents. Despite danger, people still use cell phones because they want to keep in touch with other people. Moreover, people use arguments that phones are necessary in emergency situations Although, some people support using cell phone while driving, evidence have shown that people should avoid talking while driving. Opponents whose work depend on cell phones such as lawyers, always have to be able to answer the phone to keep their business running However, they can create dangerous situations like a collision or accident. Business issues can be dangerous while driving, because emotional reactions can end in a tragedy. The conversation that the driver is having might upset them, and lower their ability to drive, this can lead to an accident. So if people don't decide to put their cell phones away, they could take a lot of innocent lives. Some people predict that hand-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. Although, hand-free devices don't eliminate accidents it worsen it by suggesting this gesture is safe. Even headsets can be unsafe because it can distract the driver from the road. When the car swerves unexpectedly or a pedestrian is in the road, the mind lacks the amount of react time need to prevent an accident from happening. So the problem isn't holding the steering wheel and cell phone at the same time, but it's just the simple fact that the conversation and lack of reaction at that moment. People argue cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency When you need your cell phone the most it's hard to find because they are stuck in the car Drivers around the world shouldn't full depend on their cell phones, because if the car accident is terrible a cell phone wouldn't help at that moment. OnStar is a service that deal with in-vehicle security and emergency problems. Therefore, cell phones are unnecessary while driving. Concluding, if people don't give up cell phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. Its people responsibility to not their own and others people lives at risk. No matter how right you think it is, it's a state law to not use cell phones while driving. Don't be a selfish driver on the road.",
    "I think that the idea of driverless cars are a good idea, but I don't think they are necessary at all. They are pointless and cars should be driven manually. The idea of a safer car is too ensure the safety of passengers, drivers , and even pedestrians. Accidents are always going to happen, but it is up to drivers themselves to make this happen. A good opposition to the idea of driverless cars is the psychological aspect. In the passage, it says, \"psychological aspects are really a challenge,\" and they should be. There is no point in having a driverless car that still needs the assistance of a human driver. Also, we aren't really saving gas amounts. The driverless cars are still going to require gasoline as fuel. In conclusion, driverless cars are not worth the investment. They will still need human assistance and drivers will be bored waiting for their turn to drive. The amount of gas needed will still be the same to power all the cars. This is why driverless cars are pointless. ",

Advice has a very big impact, especially for people who are young People dont just only ask or talk to one person when seeking for advice, they ask multiple people The more people that give you advice, the more successful you will become in life if you are going to do something that has a negative outcome, multiple people can change your mind. Every person has different beliefs and views to everything and it can be very helpful at times. Someones advice can stick with you throughout your entire life and help you when you are in a tough spot. There could also be some misleading advice. For example if someone gives a piece of advice that you truly believe has a negative outcome, do not use it Some advice makes you rethink a situation and change the outcome. If you think a situation is bad and you ask someone advice, it can be very helpful. If you think someone is in a bad situation, you give them some advice too. If you give someone your advice they will be very thankful and might do the right thing.\n advice is beneficial. If someone gives you advice, you should cherish it.

Aliens would'nt accure on mars to make a mark, if they were real they would be much farther then mars. This landform has been their for over 18 years so the odds are not aliens but erosion on the planet mars. Back then itwasnt seeable but now it is due to these erosions.

Also any aircrafts, small shacks, or airplains would be able to be seen in the picture due to the pixels in the camera. The camera would be able to see anything that goes on mars. All of the details that you see is just shadows from the rock That makes it look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose, and thats why the face is a natural land form and not made by alens. ",
    "If my principal had decided that\nALL\nstudents must participate in at least one extracurricular activity for example students could participate in sports, work on the year book, or serve on the student council. I would strongly disagree there is people like me that dont want to do sports and would just rather go straight home after along day of school some could not physically do sports\u00a0or stuff like that lastly i think i will just make students mad so you will have a lot\u00a0of students yelling and talking back and not doing what they are supposed to do.\n I don't think you should be forced to play a sport or something like because if you want to do it you will do it so there is no need to be force by principal. After school people just want to go home school is long enough so having an after school activity will just make some people upset and because I will be mad if i get forced to participate in an activity that will take time out of my day, and besides people have stuff to do also after school, some people dont have time for that. Some students have disabilities so some of them won't be able to do that stuff and they have to go straight home after school. i'm just saying if the principal does that there will be a lot\u00a0of complaints for example why do they have to do it and we have stuff to do this is not fare. If all the students will be forced to do something like that they will all be tired the next day because some people are just not used to it like me for example. I dont think it is wrong sports are very good for you for example sports are good exercise and you could try something new, and you could even learn that you like a sport, but if some one wants to do an activity or play sports they can do it on there own they dont have to be forced for that stuff if you want to do it you will do it if you dont you shouldn't be forced that just going to make the students mad and aggressive That should be something you supposed to do on your own.",
    "Have you ever seen an illusion where it looked like a figure, but then you realize it was just something else?\nEveryone has had that happen, and that is because your brain is being fooled. Recently, research shows that your brain assumes something when it looks like what you think of. For example, the pop icon, known as the \"Face of Mars,\" has fooled many scientists as NASA, making them believe that aliens were trying to give out signals. Unlike the other scientists, I believe that this \"Face on Mars\" is just a natural landform that looks similar to a human face. First of all, I believe that this peculiar face was made from the winds on Mars. It is true that when erosion occurs on Earth, tiny sediments of rocks are moved away from the original rock. I believe that erosion also occurs on Mars because a rock that looks like a face does not show up all of the sudden. Also, as you can see in the picture Viking 1 photographed, you can see tiny holes on the forehead of this rock. It is my opinion that this rock was eroded at some time and started to form a figure of a face. Secondly, the picture resolution of the rock was not as clear as it is today. because of the resolution, the image looked similar to a human face. Also, at the time of 1976, scientists still believed in the theory of aliens. However, about 22 years later, the workers at NASA captured the image of the rock again, but this time they used higher resolution. Then scientists were putting it all together by finding out that this rock was not a signal coming from Martians. So because of the resolution of the picture, the sceintists assumed that the rock came from aliens. However, just because this face-like rock is from aliens doesn't mean that the theory of aliens isn't true. There are still many beliefs that aliens exist. For example, in 1957, there was a group of aliens coming toward a farmer. However, they left Earth and there were no other signs of aliens from then. Then there was the flying saucer in the sky in 2013.\nMany people assumed that it was a UFO, and there are still some research about that incident today. So even though that there was no sign of life on Mars, there has to be life somewhere out in the universe. In conclusion, people still believe that the \"Face on Mars\" still came from aliens. Some people are like me, who believe that the rock was formed from erosion and that scientists didn't have the resolution at the time to figure out that it wasn't really a human face. Overall, the rock was just a mesa on Mars.",
    "Today, technology is rapidly advancing virtually everywhere. The iPhone, electric cars, large appliances, and many more useful new technological inventions have improved and helped assist everyone with their everyday tasks in a quick and resourceful manner. The new technology of the modern world is in workplaces, homes, and best of all, schools. Technology in school has rapidly increased especially as every student at Generic_School now has their own laptop for their own educational use. Now every student can get their work done through a computer at school, but not every student or teacher prefers it. Therefore, today, some schools offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online testing and course learning on their own. Many students and especially parents are skeptical of these online distance courses because they think that the old fashioned way of staying in school and using paper and pencil is the optimal way of learning. On the other hand, many people think otherwise, so this has become a great debate in the system of education for many counties and individual schools. Students would benefit from being able to attend or complete a class from home because they can still complete their course or courses task's at home even if they're sick some students don't enjoy public school so taking courses at home is more comfortable\u00a0for those, many teachers prefer that their course be taken online at home anyway due to the course's content and structure because it can help the student perform better. First, a big reason that a student falls behind and under performs\u00a0in a class is because they missed school due to being sick and they weren't able to learn it when they got back. Attending a class online at home is a great way to stay on pace and not fall behind because all of the information is at the student's fingertips and they can complete their tests and assignments when they are ready and able. They can still also do everything at home while they are sick if they would really like, since all of their materials is already with them on their computer. This way, the student will not fall behind in class, there is less stress, and they won't under perform\u00a0on their exams because they are still able to learn the information they need on their laptop as usual. On the other hand, if a student is sick and cannot go to school that day, they miss all of their class papers and notes from that day and cannot usually make up what they missed. For this reason, online courses are a much safer and reliable way of learning that do not have the stress of missing a full day of information at school. Online courses may also have to be used for every course anyway before long due to the rapid spread and worry over the lethal Corona Virus, which can close schools and put people in quarantine for weeks. Next, many students today are uncomfortable at a public school setting, so they are unable to perform as well in their classes and they don't do well with other people. Some are just naturally shy and others just simply do not like working with others. For this reason, attending online classes at home is a great alternative for these students who are not socially comfortable. This way, students can complete projects on their own at home and they can stay focused on their tasks without the awkward feeling of having to worry about others at public school. Another strong quality of attending and completing an online course is that many online courses have fun and interactive lessons that keep a student engaged in the lesson, rather than sitting in a classroom and doing nothing because they are bored of the teaching or they are once again, just\u00a0uncomfortable socially in a public setting. One on one online video conferencing is also easier for students to talk to their teachers if they need help because they may feel uneasy when speaking to a teacher or others in person. As a result, they also can learn things in an online course that they may not have ever learned if they were taking that certain course in a public school setting. Lastly, many teachers prefer and advise that a course be taken online and at home due to the structure and content of the course because they believe the students will perform stronger by taking the course online. For example, many students take Econ and Personal Finance online at home during the summer because it doesn't necessarily need a full school year to complete and it can all be self taught through interactive lessons and simulations. These simulations could include learning to complete a tax form or something of the sort that can be completed individually. Also, many English courses can be taken online and some teachers encourage it because many English classes are writing oriented, in which much of the class involves writing essays and research papers on a computer anyway. Therefore, just attending a course such as these at school can be extra work and a potential waste of a students time since it can all be self taught and completed at home online. Teachers specifically may prefer online courses a lot of the time because they do not want to repeat the same exact information to every single one of their class periods and that is usually self explanatory anyway. When courses are taken online at home, the teachers are able to structure the course into interactive courses that can be self taught and completed individually, so that the students can be more successful on their own, rather than taking up a lot of extra time that is unnecessary at a classroom in school. \nIn conclusion, attending and completing online courses at home would be beneficial to students because the course may be learned individually without the social stress of public school, the students won't fall behind if they are sick, and many teachers advise attending courses online due to their students abilities to perform stronger in the course and its better online structure.

    "In many cases there is two sides to an arguement. When there is two sides to an arguement it could go either way. In this case the arguement is about the electoral college. What is the electoral college,it is the the process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the consitution as a compromise between election of president by a vote in congress and election of presidentby popular vote of qualilfied citizens.(stated in paragraph 1) I believe strongly that we should keep the electoral college, beacuse it keeps people from directly voting for a presdient keeps everything even and mostlikely fair. Most people think that we should get rid of the electoral college,its clearly a state of opinion. When you really sit down and think about how most people vote in the Northeast and South they are not the thoughtful voters. (said in paragraph 19 line 2 paragraph 4) Take obama for an example, he was the first black presidental canidate and most of the darker skined group of people got excited because for the first time in history a black man could be president,many blacks thought that voting for the black president would mean that they would better respersatition in office,so many blacks and some whites voted for obama to win. Not really paying much attention to what or who they were voting for. Which you could probably figure out that obama won they had the bigger vote. If we are able to keep the electoal college it would mean that wouldnt happen agian because it could go through the electorals they would choose who is best. Dont get me wrong people actually voted for obama anyways ,because of what he\u00a0 stood for but most didn't. In reality most people think that the voting is unfair, like what happened with Presidnet Kennedy. Kennedy was the stronger, better canidate to be president. I believe that the electors chose right, it may not have been who the people wanted. He was way better then Nixon could ever be. That may have made the people very mad,which led to the assination of President Kennedy. Kenndey changed the country and to this day in my mind, known as one of the best presdidents we ever had. Thanks to the electoral system we had Kennedy elected instead of Nixon,could you just imagine how the country would be today. If Kennedy didnt win,or if Nixon was president just one little thing could change everything. Everything happens for a reason and having the electoral college helps. I know that Nixon has the popular vote but kennedy needed to win for the better of our country,its my state of opinion. \n Most people think that having the electoral college is bad,why? because they believe that the people should be able to vote directly. I understand how and why they believe that. When you think about votin directly it would insure the people that whoever they are voting for they would be sure to get thier votes and for sure get the president that they wished to be president. I could truley undertsand why and this would work out, but i still strongly believe that this could be the cause to many problems. In conclusion,I beleive that we shoudl keep the electoral college becaue he keeps the people for choosing a president direlcetly. If they make a bad chose someone,who knows is the better canidate that they could over rule the peoples vote. So it would all fair in most turns and would possibably helping the country,and many people believe otherwise its truely a state of opinion. You choose who chooses the president. ",
    "Their are some schools that offer to attend online classes or video conferencing what if they don't have a computer at home for to be able to use it for the online class. Some parents will not agree I think because they will be working and they don't know with who they can leave their kids with. Video Conferencing could work for students instead of online classes because that way the person that will come to teach you can explain more better from the assignments that your suppose to do. Some students just prefer someone to teach them for they can help with what they are doing Students will benefit from being abkle to attend classes from home will some students they would rather take classes home then school because in school they think it's more harder for them for the reason of being with alot of stusdents They like to work alone quite and with someone who can have patients and work slowly and have time Same thing with there schedule when you have classes at home you can choose the time and day that you want to do the class. \u00a0 \u00a0 ",
    "The united states has this ellection system called the electoral collage. The electoral collage is a system of voting for verious comities. When the founding fathers of The united states made the constitution the electoral collage was a part of it Why would any one want to change the electoral collage because i would like to know. In my oppinion in is the best thing i know of for a working government Over the years there has been a larg number of amendments to the constitution, but that was to adjust it to the chang in todays tecnology. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is theated like a state for purposes of the Electoral collage.\nThe electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorsvotes is required to elect the President. Most states have a \"winner-take -all\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. So another words whoever gets the most votes wins but the odds are which ever side has the larger amount of people voting republican or democrat is normaly who wins. because if your a republican your most likly to vote democrat. \n Everything that is rong with the electoral collage Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry ",
    "Offering distance learning as an optoion for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a good idea for the students. Some students for distance sometimes can be an issue, as for others they can't go to school for there health issues, for others it would still be teacher to student/s. Transportation can be dificult with that issue, and something that issue effects going to school. The car can break down, the tire car wheel can pop, something can just stop working making the car act up. making the distance to school seem longer then it should, and it being unsafe to drive at times. Better to stay safe then sorry. Sometimes you could be a whole city way, or state away dealing with family issues. School work would be one thing less on you're shoulders for your problems. Then there is the issue of being sick. With this, sick poeple would be able to stay home and not spread their grems and get others sick. Maybe you're having a medical issue where you could be at the hospital,this way you could be in 2 places at once. you would be in the hosppital bed learnign about math while the rest of your class is at school learning about the same thing. At home on bed rest? You could easily hope on to the website they have, and you could be learning at the same time as them about the topic. Some students need, that one on one with a teacher to learn somethings. with being online or video conferencing those students then have that one on one with the teachers. Some of those students are the right then and there or never again type of students. Where if they don't ask then and there they won't remember what the y want to ask or what they were going to say. Then others would just like to see their favorite teacher to left there hopes being sick or to far from home. With all of this, giving students the option to go online to get there schooling while sick helps. Or when they may need help with something so they do video conferencing so they may understand directly what the teacher is trying to get to. so even with trouble with distance, or the health issues you may have. And for some, just the speaking to others help. These are some reasons that benefit from being able to attend classes from home.\u00a0",

    "There is a concern that students come back to school\u00a0not being ready to learn. Matter of fact, according to\nGeneric_City Times,\n88% of students coming back from summer break are not mentally ready for school. Students and their families take vacations to free their mind off of school/work. Being off for three months for vacations/ free time, can be difficult for the students, as they come back to school. Students come back \"rusty\"\u00a0or\u00a0not ready, because their mind is still set on having a good time with friends and not doing any homework. To solve this problem (of students not being ready for school), school boards are deciding to require summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The question the school board is asking is, should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects should be designed by the student students will pick a topic of interest will not get a topic that they don't like, teachers may give students challenging projects students are not capable of doing. Picking your own topic for a summer project can lead to better grades. According to \"Academic Awards\", students achieved better grades when they work on a subject of choice. A student said at the awards, \"When I got to write about Hockey, which is my favorite sport, I put so much effort and time into my paper. I loved to write about how great of a game Hockey is. I truly believe that if you are allowed to write about a topic that you have true passion for, it will lead to great success. This aspect does not only apply to school work, but also the real world.\" There have been many studies on how \"doing the thing you love\" will bring you great success That same aspect goes with school, students learn and perform better when they are learning a subject of interest. Normally, students do not like the topic of research a teacher assigns. People who went through school know that we have always had projects/ papers that do not fit our interest Students slack on this aspect because they do not have true passion into what they are writing (not interested) or learning One student from Generic_School states, \"My true passion was history, I loved to write about the challenges, wars, and new changes of the world. I was looking forward to writing papers about history because this is the topic that ultimately interested me, but when I had to write about a science paper, I had absolute no interest writing about it. I would make up excuses to myself on why I shouldn't write this paper.\" Teachers teach about mandatory subjects that are either boring or not interesting. If summer assigned projects are brought to the attention, then teachers should not give out their own idea of what the student has to complete. Not only do teachers pick uninteresting topics to research about, but they also pick topics that may be to challenging for the writer to complete. Teachers give out topics of study that are challenging for the student to learn about and can bring a student down (not wanting to complete the assignment). A student from Generic_City said, \"If I got a paper that was teacher-designed and difficult, I would not be up to do it. We already had to go through a whole school year doing what they teacher wanted us to do, why can't we choose our own topic for the summer?\" If a student gets a topic from a teacher that is to hard for them to achieve during summer, then they will procrastinate to finish it. Teachers have the whole school year to give out challenging projects to students, but for summer projects, a student should not be assigned hard and rigorous work. Students should design their own summer projects because they will value their project more, won't get a bad topic (get to choose own topic), and don't have to deal with challenging topics teachers hand out. There have been many factors that have been in place to deal with students not coming mentally prepared on the first day of school. Should summer be shortened? Should schools give out homework for students to complete during the summer, so learning will be longer lasting? At the end of the day, no matter what the belief is about school work being done over the summer, student should be able to design and apply their own project.\u00a0",

    "Im going to tell about how the author of the article ''The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is trying to convince people to explore and stuying one of our 8 plants called \"Venus\". He starts off by geeting in detail with describing how vevus is by stating \" Venus sometimes caleed the Evening Star,is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky,and saying venus is the second plant fro our sun. Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closet in distance too. He also discribed the plant as a cloud-draped world, and says maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched downn on venus in more than three decades The author also gets into some math into this by breaking down some percentages that venus has compared to other plants by saying. \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus \". he also says that one the plants surface , temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and theatmosphere pressure is 90 times gretaer than what they have experienced on earth. Venus has the hottest surface tempertature of many plants in our solar system, even with mercury being closer to the sun. He basically telling us about the percentages and the deepest amont of venus and other plants we didnt reaserch about. In more of the storyhe tells you the things yo are exprcted to see on venus. Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth. The planet has a surfae of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. He changes the subject and goesminto the NASA and how they have ideas on sending humas to study venus he describes how going out there would be like by saying imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above theroiling venusian landscape. Also at thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but tha air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth ",
    "A lot of people don't know that this techonolgy nowadays could determine the way you feel, it could determine the emotions that peope feel. It also shows the emotions or feelings of others. People probably think that this some type of joke or laugher kind of way when its not there really is techonology nowadays that could detect it. There's probably many ways people can detect to read the emotional expressions of students. Some ways that you probably didn't even know of. A lot of people wonder how this works they don't really know that one easy way to show emotion or to show how you feel is by looking at them and looking at their actions. Once you have already seen them and that they are feeling some kind of way that's when you realize that there is something going on or that their sad or happy or that they are just going through stuff. People know that by the facial expressions on their face. They say that us as humans perform the same impressive \"calculation\". Some people struggle or have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried,sad,etc. This would be one easy way students can detect emotions. Parents probably disagree about using technology when showing their emotions. Not just parents but maybe some students wouldn't like it either but if they think about it instead of waisting your time just guessing what their emotions are you would know if they use the proper techonology. They had made a process that began when the computer constructed a 3-D computer model of the face and it showed that all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Another interesting thing that they discovered was that Dr. Paul Eckman was the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). He had classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It also associated each with characterestic movements of the facial muscles. They invented somethIng else called video imagery, the new emotion software is that they track facial movement As you can see its so easy to see their emotions or how they feel. They even show different weighting of units. The author says that the Mona Lisa demonstrates is really to bring a smile to peoples face while it shows how much the computer can do. It would be really strange if a computer can tell you if your happy or sad. \n In my opinion parents and students should get the idea of using techonology its way easier to detect peoples emotions instead of just guessing or thinking you know how they feel. They shouldn't have a problem trying to make the place better. ",
    "There will most likely be a future without the transportation system that we know today. Driverless cars will probably be used in place of both public transportation and personal transportation. The problem is, driverless cars might not be the best thing for us Driverless cars should not be developed they aren't completely driverless, they are inconvenient they aren't safe. they aren't completely driverless. This can be seen in paragraph 2 of the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" when the author writes, \"...Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over.\" And in paragraph 7, the author states, \"In fact, none of the cars developed are completely driverless.\" This shows that there are still things that the driverless cars cannot accomplish and the use of a human driver is completely neccecary. that they are expensive and inconvenient. The cars require a bunch of sensors and electronic tools that will raise the cost of cars. In paragraph 4, the author says,\n\"For starters, they need a whole lot of sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reviever, and and inertial motion sensor.\" That is a decent amount of tools that will need to be added to a car, not including what is needed to make the car drive. Also, because the cars aren't completely driverless, drivers will have to keep hold of the wheel. This is seen in paragraph 7 when it says, \"...special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.\" This is inconvenient because even though the car is driving itself, drivers still have to be alert and be ready as if they are driving the car. This will caus drivers to get bored waiting to see if they will have to drive. In paragraph 8, Dr. Werner Huber states, \"The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge.\" This reveals that it is inconvenient to have the car driving while the driver is waiting in case she has to drive. Another inconvenience is that in some of the cars, they can only handle really slow speeds. Paragraph 7 states, \"The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph.\" This is inconvenient because most of the time cars drive at speeds faster than 25 miles per hour, and the feature of the driverless car will not be used very often. Because of all of the equipment required to make a driverless car run, and how little the feature will be used, driverless cars will be inconvenient and aren't worth being developed. Most importantly, driverless cars aren't safe. In most states, driverless cars are illegal because lawmakers are concerned about their safety. This can be seen in paragraph 9 when the author states, \"In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars.\" This reveals that states don't even think it is safe to test the cars, much less use the cars on the road. Even manufacturers acknowledge that there are many issues with these cars. Paragraph 10 states, \"Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.\" This shows that the automakers see the problems but are just assuming that they will go away. The reader can imply that the safety is being ignored because they are just assuming the problems will go away. Although driverless cars are perdicted to be the mode of transportation, because of the fact that driverless cars aren't completely driverless, they are inconvenient, and they aren't safe, driverless cars should not be deveoped.",
    "As technology advances through modern times, previously impossible technologoies and processes become feasible. One such technology that fits this description is the driverless car. While the driverless car in the past seemed nothing more than a popular topic in science fiction, the technology of driverless cars has become very real in recent years, with companies such as Google and Tesla developing their own driverless cars. Driverless cars should be developed and used they are extremely convenient provide greater levels of safety for humans. The convenience of driverless cars are clear to see. A driverless car would be able to take over the control of the car during the mundane activities of everyday driving, such as being stuck in slow traffic or a monotonous drive down the interstate. In 2013, BMW began development on a \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" which would allow a car to take over control from the driver during slow driving situations when there is little skill required from a driver. Imagine that the next time a person was stuck in traffic, they could just let the car take over while he or she relaxed, unfrustrated by the stop and go movement of cars in a traffic jam. Another positive feature of driverless cars is that, according to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, they would consume about half as much gas as standard cars do today. This would be better for both the driver, as he or she would spend less on gas, and the environment, as there would be less consumption of fossil fuels and less emission into the atmosphere. The convenience of a driverless car is undeniable. In the current state of driving, the majority of accidents are caused by human error. These errors can come in various forms, whether it be a person not braking soon enough, driving through a red light, or operating his or her vehicle recklessly. These prevalent problems that continually cause accidents for humans could be stopped completely if autonomous cars were used. Autonomous cars would be programmed so that they wouldn't go dangerously fast, and their sensors would warn them when to brake and how much pressure to apply to the brake. The issue of drunk driving would also become less of a problem as the car would have control of the wheel and wouldn't make the same judgement errors than an intoxicted driver might. Driverless cars can only become safer. Some might argue that driverless cars aren't truly autonomous yet, and that issues could appear if there is a system error with the car. While it is true that competely driverless cars aren't available yet, companies such as Google and Tesla are continually developing driverless cars to handle more and more driving situations, and the only time that a driver is required to take over control of the wheel is in complex situations such as maneuvering through roadwork or a car accident. While system errors could occur, these issues would become increasingly uncommon the further that the technology of autonomous cars is developed, and legislature would not allow the legalization of completely driverless cars until it is shown that the likelihood of an error is either extremely unlikely or non-existent. As time goes on, driverless cars can only improve and become safer and more convenient for drivers.\n Driverless cars will continually be developed to create the safest and most convenient riding experience for passengers. While some flaws exist today and there are still some instances which require human skill at the wheel, these instances are becoming less and less common due to improving software and the use of sensors in these vehicles. Driverless cars are the future of the driving experience. ",
    "In the article, the author does present a lot of postitives and negative aspects of driverless cars. i am for the development of these cars. technology keeps growing and spreading wider each day. In the article it says how these cars are already on the way of being developed, Goolgle has had cars that could drive indepedently, but only under certain conditions. Googles cars have driven more then half a million miles without a crash, so you know that the \"Driverless Cars\" will be safe. I personally think that these cars would benifit people and the world in many ways Gooogle cofounder Sergey Brin says that the cars he foresees would use half of the fuel of todays taxis and that it could offer way more flexibility then a bus, these cars would fundamentally change the world. Plus driving would be at at a way lower risk of car accidents, because it is a smart computer telling the car what to do. The \"driverless cars\" have already made alot of progress and alt of diffrent companies are trying to make these, as safe and as fast as possible. The company BMW announced the develpoment of the \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" in 2013. The car can Brake, steer, and accelerate all by themselves. The person in the car has to have his or her hands on the wheel at all times because they are not made completly driverless yet, but they are getting more advanced every year, and i believe that someday driverless things will be a thing, and i hope it is More lives will be safe. Less gas will be used so its better for our enviroment.",
    "Ford, Volkswagen, Kia, and Chevy's... while these car brands may have been a massive part of the American culture, its significance in our lives may be declining.\u00a0 According to recent studies and stories from around the world, car transportation popularity is decreasing dramatically. Some advantages of limiting car usage that the United States will benifit from include reducing greenhouse gases emitted making for a better environment, less usage of cars can lower stress and is safer. \n By limiting the amount that the citizens of the United States operate their vehicles, the condition of our environment's atmosphere will improve.\u00a0 As stated in Source 1, \"and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\"\u00a0 This passage is referring to the amount of greenhouse gas emitted here in America because of passenger cars.\u00a0 By not using car and taking advantage of other methods of transportation such as buses, walking, and riding a bike that number can be reduced significantly.\u00a0 In the United States we are also learning from mistakes made by other countries and cities.\u00a0 \"After days of near-record pollution,\" Source 2 says, \"Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\"\u00a0 A lesson can be taken from Paris of how we do not want to end up in a situation like that.\u00a0 By limiting our driving currently we can avoid having to take major steps to clean and clear our environment.\u00a0 \"It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,\" a sociologist predicts in Source 4. A decent amount of stress comes with owning and operating a motorized vehicle.\u00a0 You are constantly worrying about if you will be late, or if you have enough gas to make it from point A to point B.\u00a0 Children are another concern and trying to keep them safe around roads and driving by themselves.\u00a0 Limiting the use of cars can create a less stressful, and safer society.\u00a0 In Source 3 it explains that, \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\"\u00a0 Lowering the use of cars can make life a little less busy because it is one thing less that you have to worry about throughout your day.\u00a0 Heidrun Walter said, in Source 1, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.\"\u00a0 Although the use of cars may be convienent, the benifits of limiting the usage may be beginning to outweight the inconviences. Between reducing the greenhouse gas creating a cleaner environment as well as lessening stress and making the roads safer, the advantages of limiting car usage in the United States are major. ",
    "I'm aware that there are two ways of electing the president of the United States. According to Source 1 \"What is the Electoral College?\", the Electoral College is a process where electors get elected to vote for President and Vice President. The other option is popular vote. Popular vote is when the people vote, and which ever Candidate gets the most votes wins the election. I personally feel that you should not keep the Electoral College. In my opinion, election by popular vote is a better strategy of electing the President and Vice President of the United States Electoral College is a horrible strategy, because voters are not actually voting for the President, they are voting for a slate of electors. Under the Electoral College system, voters don't actually get to vote for the President, and Vice President. According to Source 2 \"What's wrong with the electoral college?\", the voters vote for a slate of electors who will elect the President. It's possible that the voters may not even know much about the electors that will be electing the President. The electors can be anyone, it depends on what state you are in. According to Source 2 \"What's wrong with the electoral college?\", sometimes the electors may be elected by state conventions, the state party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves. Voters can't even control who their electors vote for sometimes. What if voters choose an elector, and the elector doesn't even vote for the President that the voter was hoping they will vote for? That seems unfair to me, because during this process, there's a chance that the voter may not even get to actually vote for the candidate that they wanted to vote for. This is why I feel that popular vote is more accurate. Voters get to vote for the candidate that they want to win to be the President, and know that their vote will count. They don't have to worry about electing an elector that can possibly vote for a different candidate. So, may you please consider removing the Electoral College, and replacing it with popular vote?. I'm sure it will make many voters happy that their vote will actually count, and that they will not have to vote for an elector. ",
    "When you need advice about whether you should go with the pink dress or the blue dress, or what kind of dog you should get, you might want to ask multiply people for advice. I believe that it is smarter to ask multiply people you might not like the answer one gives you, it's good to have a back up plan, it's good to have multiple options of what to do. If you are trying to decide the best way to break up with your boyfriend then you might ask a friend. If that friend says to just go up and say it to his face and not care about what he feels, you might not think that's the nicest way to break up with him. You would want to ask someone else for advice about what to do because may not like the answer to you got. Another friend might say to go up and slowly ease him into it. Imagine you need a dress for the dance on Friday. You ask a couple of your friends what dress you should get. They sent you a list of dresses and you decide that you like the navy one. You go to the store and they tell you that they are all sold out of the navy dress. Normally you would be screwed, but then you remember they sent you a whole list. You also liked the pink one so you decide to get that one. Say you want to get a dog. You ask all of your friends what the best dog is and why. They come up to you and tell about how well the are with kids, if they bark a lot, if they are hypoallergenic, how big they get, and how playful and cute they are. You look at all your options and decide the best dog for you is the toy poodle. I believe that it is important to ask multiple people for advice. You can have multiple ideas for if you don't like one or for if you need a back up plan. It's also important to have multiple ideas for great big decisions. It can never hurt to ask for multiple people for advice, but it can certainly help.",

    "Extracurricular activities are exhilarating in a variety of different ways Extracurriculars can also be very helpful in the future Getting involved in an extracurricular activity is a phenomenal way to make new friends obtain special skills. People that are participating in the same club or sport have one common interest For example, my friend is in the Photography Club, and she has met some people that also enjoy taking candid photographs just like she does. My brother is also in the Drama Club at Generic_School all the people in the Drama Club with my brother have the same passion for acting as my brother does. Being on a sports team can help when you trust the other people on the team. When students are on sports teams coaches like to play icebreaker games to help everyone on the team get to know each other, and to trust each other. If and when every team member trusts everyone on the team they can start playing like a team.\n In school students sometimes pretend to be someone they aren't but when they are at their club or at sports practice they become their true selves.\nStudents are afraid to be who they really are because they think if they show others the real them then they won't be liked. Though when their in a club or on a team they begin to feel less afraid and are more comfortable with their peers. These are the reasons why I\nthink joining an extracurricular activity would help students make friends. Being on a sports team requires having an enormous amount of stamina and effort. For instance, when boys join the football team they have to work really hard to build up their stamina to run really far, and to block the opposing team from scoring. They also have to practice, and if they actually want to have a chance of winning they need to put in a tremendous amount of effort while in practice to do so. Someone on the football team with a little practice can gain the skill of building up a gigantic amount of stamina and, they can learn to put as much effort as they can into everything they do. If people join a club they can learn leadership skills and learn to be more confident. An example of this is if someone joined the school newspaper, and they were named head editor they would have to give people articles to write, and would edit and go over people's work with them. The editor would learn how to lead their peers to victory with the printing of the finalized copy of the school paper. Also, if a person joined the debate team they would learn to speak clearer, and with more confident. skill that people can learn if they join a club is learning to be patient. When I was in 7th grade I was in a club called best buddies, and in this club I was helping disabled kids with little projects and things that were difficult for them. Working with them taught me that I need to be more patient with people because someone never knows what another person is going thorough. This is why participating in an extracurricular activity will help you learn special skills. Joining after school activities is a outstanding way to establish friendships,and learn impressive skills. Students will never know what to expect when it come to after school\u00a0activities. But it is always an adventure.",
    "Extracurricular activities are commonly found at all schools. They range from basketball and football, to book club and yearbook club. There are limitless possibilities to extracurricular activities you could do. These activities are important because they allow you to make new friends and be social get better at skills that arent taught in normal school, and they allow you to do something fun and participate in something besides school. Being social is one of the most important aspects of life. Making friends, having fun and spending time with each other. When you are in school, you can talk to your friends but you cannot truly bond with them because you have school work that you need to focus on. In regular school, you are taught all of the subjects that you are used to seeing. Math, science, English and even some special electives like shop. School is stressful, and when you only think about school, it gets worse and worse and a lot of people need a break from school. Extracurricular activities should be a part of every students life and are extremely important to their success because of the social aspect, the fact that they are new activities with different skill sets, and they give you a break from school which allows you to think about something else. They can even make someone healthier, mentally and physically. They are important to the students and can change how they feel over their entire career as a student.",
    "School projects are required for students at certain schools to complete over the summer to prove that they are still learning over their break. The summer projects should be student designed, because they are not in school at the time. If the teachers want to assign a project to the students for a period that they are not enrolled in the school system, they can atleast throw the ball into the students court on where to take it from there. As long as the student sticks to the theme of the project. A project to show you're learning something like the one in this case, can be taken through many different routes. Summer is a school vacation. When most schools let out for the break, they don't hold the students accountable for any school work. Unless say you were participating in home school, which would be a different story. Although this school inparticular has a different prespective by wanting the reassurance that their students are not brain-washed throughout the next couple months off. Assigning a simple tasks to show your teacher that you have really learned something, is not bad when student-designed, as long as kept within appropriate boundaries. When you get assigned something, with the choice to choose where you go from there, you will result in a better outcome. Learning something that you are curious, or excited about will give you a whole different experience. When something intrests you, you gain motivation. If the teachers had chose to design a project for the students, it would most likley be a clique. Im thinking thick stacks of paper you have to read through, by following up questions and writting. There is already enough of that work in school. If that is what the school would be going for with the summer project, they might as well find a way to cancel summer out completely. Being a pupil myself I know that as soon as I walk out of those school doors, I'm free for the next couple months. If you throw a stack of paper work at me at that time, I'm most likley to hold off, or forget about it copletely. As for i had just got released from that type of routine. Throwing extreme school paperwork at me as soon as I get free from that, doesn't make the most sense. If thats the case, cancel out summer completely, because the tradition of summer is a school vacaction. Say you simply hand the students a one sheet of paper stating that they need to come back into the next school year, exhibiting that they learned something intresting or new over the summer, you will get better outcome. Once you release the kids from the school, especially for summer you are not going to get the same energy out of most of them. If they are not enrolled at the time, the bottom line is that they really do not owe you anything. Giving pupils that freedom, then throwing what they are getting away from right back at them is not the way to go with this. Doing that, a lot of kids will have no desire nor care at all to complete that task. Summer is about chill and good vibes. Throw something simple but effective at the students, then you tell me if you achieve a good outcome in return .",
    "Have you ever struggled in a certain activity, or just wanted to join a new club.\nMany students often feel that way and don't know what to do, but there are many after school clubs that help out in that regard Students who are struggling in certain subject could stay after school with a teacher to help in that situation Many schools also provide sport clubs so that students interested would join, and possible lend them a scholarship into collage Students who participate in extracurricular activities are more likely to make stronger bonds with others With so many benefits to staying after school, I believe that students should stay after school in at least one club.\n There are many instances in which students struggle to keep high grades up, and don't know what to do There are many extracurricular activities that may help in that scenario. Students can find clubs in which they can get help by teachers to do work there struggling to finish.\nIf a student missed a day of school and can't catch up, teachers can stay after and show them and important information that they missed. Tests can bring stress to students , and even make them panic a little, when that happens students can request that\u00a0teacher help them and even give tips on how to relax and focus. Trying to juggle so many things at once can be difficult for most students, but teachers are there to help out those in need. Sport clubs are one of the most popular clubs in some schools, and for good reason. Clubs like these offer students a chance to play the sport they like and represent the school at the same time. Sport clubs also give participants\u00a0the opportunity to hang out with friends and create new ones along the way. In some rare chances collages may offer them a fully paid scholarship if they see the student overall success, and while it even rarer some professionals may be interested and ask them to join there team Sports clubs offer students many opportunities\u00a0to get a head start in life and even get them interested in new hobbies.\n Students coming to a new school for the first time might be timid or feel alone during the first few day, so why not ask them to come to after school. Extracurricular activities offer new students the change to make new friends and even help strengthen old ones. Many group of friends often hang out after school to just hang out or relax from the stressful day. Many clubs also relate to specific peoples interest, so people can meet others who are interested in their hobbies. Every person is unique and some may struggle to make new bonds, after school activities can help them meet people who share the same hobbies or help steanthen bonds After school clubs are some of the key factors in schools. They help them keep high grades, Gives students the chance to do there hobbies like sport, and may even help new kids to make bonds or steanthen them. So I Believe that students should stay after school at least once, to see new interest or make new friends.",

    "In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author states that exploring Venus would be an immense challenge to overcome due to all of the extremely harsh conditions. Venus, also known as the \"Evening Star,\" is an extremely dangerous planet to explore Even though scientists are aware of these difficult factors, people like the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" still think that being informed about this bright point of light is worth it. \n According to astronomers, Venus may have at one point been the planet with the most Earth-like features. Venus is said to now have a \"surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" These characteristics are one of the reasons as to why the author states that Venus is a pursuit worth risking many things for. Another reason is because in paragraph 4, the author states \"Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.\" Although these are all fair reasons to want to visit Venus once again, astronomers have to keep in mind all of the negative characteristics that will set their exploration behind. All astronomers and explorers are well aware of all of the challenging conditions such as the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere and the atmospheric pressure being 90 times greater in Venus than the pressure in Earth. These are not the only challenging conditions; another dangerous feature is that temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit in Venus's surface. Consequently, the author states in paragraph six that there are now many scienstist searching for technology that will be able to stand the harsh conditions in Venus \"Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.\" In the previous paragraph, the author informs the readers about an idea that NASA has thought of. The plan for sending people to study Venus would not give the necessary information to be properly informed of this volatile planet. All of these obstacles are not enough to calm human's desire of knowledge about unearthly topics. In paragraph eight, the author says that all of the challenges are not enough to mellow down our curiosity enough to quit studying Venus. In conclusion, the claim about Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents that the author of \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus\" states is well supported by facts and perfectly thought out ideas. Although Venus is an extremely dangerous planet packed with many reasons as to why exploration is currently held back, NASA is still looking for ways to be able to gain more valuable insight about the Evening Star. Just like the author said, learning and travelling should not be limited by doubts, and scientists will not let doubts and fears stop them. ",
    "The \"Face on Mars\" is really not a a face at all. In fact, it is simply a landform. There is no alien remains or anything like that. It sure does look like a face, but that was merely a coinsidence. First of all, to prove this is a landform and not aliens is, there is only a face, no body If this really was aliens there would be a body to go along with this face. From the picture provided in the article, I can clearly see that there is a face and a fce only. Absolutely no body found. In fact, there is not even a bump or anything proving this has no body and aliens would most likely have a body if they have a head/face. The second reason as to why this cannot be an alien is, if it was an alien NASA would have found more than one by now. This landform was first discovered in 1976. That is a long time ago. If this truely was an alien that once had life, there would most definetly be more than one. But, there is not. There is only one. This is another reason proving this is not aliens, but just a landform. The third an final reason why this is nothing more than a landform, not aliens, in it would have been identified by now. NASA would have came out and said it already. There is no way we can actually prove that is actually an alien. But, we have classified it as a landform. We even have other landforms on earth to compre it too. Many say it is equivalent to a butte or mesa(many things found in the American Mest). \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" Garvin says. In conclusion, this is not aliens. This is simply a landform. Even though it does look like a face we have supporting details that back up our argument. It is clearly not an alien. Everything needed to prove this is tight in this essay. I hope that now you have come to your senses and agree with me. ",
    "we should keep the Electoral college. The college is a process,not a place. The process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice. The counting of electoral voters by congress. State's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation. The college is widely regarded as an anachronism. The Electoral college despite its lack of Democratic Pedigree. We shouldnt have to change to election by popular vote for President. The Electoral college looks like a big help to President.

    "Many people decide to take classes from home, in my opinion this should not be available for\u00a0everyone I believe that people should not be allowed to take their courses from home they do not have much physical interaction with other people they do not have any type of influence they do not have the proper environment to study and focus\u00a0at home people can also cheat if they are at home and giving their test.\n When you are at home the whole day and are taking classes online you are not able to make any physical interaction with other people when you are not interacting with other people you feel alone and you start to stress about things and you think that you do not have anyone to talk to about your issues which increases your stress level. By making physical interactions with people you are able to make bonds with other people and if you are in any type of situation you know that your friends will always have your back and that you can trust them, and also let them know that if they are in a situation in which they do not know what to do you are always there for them and will always try your best to help them. When you are at school you can also influence people in a good way and if you know that someone is doing something that they are not supposed to do, you can help them solve their issue or show them the right way to do the same thing and guide them to the right path For example: If you know that someone in your group of friends vapes\u00a0or smokes, you and your group of friends should tell him/her that it is not right to do that and tell them the consequences of doing that action. If all of you try hard to make that person stop doing something he/ she may listen. In this way you can influence people in a good way. When you are at home and are taking courses online you do not have the proper environment\u00a0to study and focus when you are at home, which for most people is the place where you got to relax, your mind knows that that specific place is for you to rest so it will think that you need to rest and will not work the way it would work at school because at school you know that you went there to study and to learn something. On the other hand, when you are at home you have many types of distractions for example when you are at home your Dad calls you to help him with something or your mom calls you to tell you something or if one of your younger sibling needs help in their homework. You have to do your work but you also have to listen to your parents. So you are not able to stay focused and maybe after listening to everyone you forgot what you learned because you had to leave it half way and you were not able to learn the whole topic. Another problem that I have heard about from several people is that when you are at home and are taking a test or an exam you can cheat When you cheat you may get a good grade but you will not have the knowledge which in long term can harm your career. For example: You are giving a final test for Spanish. You have to speak the language and you search the translation and read it off Google. You cheated on the test and got a 90%, you passed the test but you do not know how to speak that language. Now you have a degree which says that you passed your language with 90%. You go to a collage and a teacher sees your high school\u00a0degree\u00a0and starts talking in Spanish, but you cheated and do not really know how to speak Spanish. Now you are speechless and have nothing to say and you get rejected from the collage. In this way it also armed your practical life. Some people may say that there are also some people that are not able to come to school because of some specific reason or some people are influenced in a bad way at school But that does not apply to everyone, everyone is not in bad influence and if you are good yourself you would not let anyone lead you to the wrong way The people who say that some people are not able to come to school because of some specific reason, that does not apply on everyone.

Atmosphere is thick 97 percent carbon dioxide so temperatures goes up 800 degrees F and on earth the atomsphere is 90 times greater.\nSister Planet and Venus are the same thing its the better planet in the solar system which used to be covered in oceans and could supported peoples life just like the Earth. its rocky sediment and has features which are valleys, mountains, and craters.\nNASA is working on venus the samples of rock, gas etc. are not working to take the samples its rough so a scienctist knows thay venus needs to be close to do their own vperonsal depsite risk for it to last.

    "This letter is about the cell phone policy the policy I would consider to use would be the policy number one.\n I believe the policy is good making phone calls checking on others, talking to friends or family and texting to friends is good but I would make a few changes to it the first thing I would change about it would be during class teachers or staff should check the phones to see if they are turned off. The other thing I would change about is, teachers and staff should keep watch on their students if they are using their cell-phone in class because sometimes they cannot be trusted. I would still consider the policy of number one just make these few changes to it.",
    "Imagine a lost, confused version of yourself. Perhaps it's an essay, a project, or a personal situation that has you conflicted. You have no idea what to do or what to think of. You are stuck. The first thing that pops into your head is to consult your peers, but not just one. Asking for advice from more than one person has many upsides. You can see what others think of your situation, there can be many different thoughts. Someone may suggest a better idea to you than others, it is always beneficial for you to consider a different perspective. There could be multiple ideas that you didn't even think of before. For example, if you had a ton of homework, there are many different things that people could suggest. Do the hardest things first, do the easiest things first, or just wait until the next day to complete it all. They all have different opinions, but you can get it all from just asking multiple people for advice. Not all advice given is automatically good. Let's say, for example, you are planning to redecorate your bedroom. Someone offers a neon-yellow pillow for your chair. You think to yourself, no way . Someone else tells you to hang up squares cut out from cardboard around the border of the entrance. You think, huh, that's not such a bad idea , until you ask one more person. They suggest that you declutter your shelf and invest in new curtains for a clean and bright look. Brilliant! The third suggestion is far better than the rest. Consulting others for advice can help you do that. Perhaps your situation isn't as horrible as you thought, maybe it could be easily fixed and dealt with. People other than yourself can help you see the good things in bad situations. You could have this sense of relief from just consulting someone for their opinion. Simple as that! Asking more than one person for advice is critical. You can see what others think, receive many different opinions that are better than the others, and view your dilemma in a new perspective. After all of that, your situation could seem easier to understand and not so terrible as you thought. Asking just one person for their thoughts is a mistake, do not forget to ask another! ",
    "The author has great passion for this topic but has not accomplished on supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danges. The author has many points on how others are trying to solve the problems on how to explore Venus but does not explain why the risk is worthy of exicuting. \"Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk.\" This quote states that scientist need to take a risk but does not give a reason why the risk is neccesary. This is not the only way the author did not accomplish on supporting the idea. The author explains the history of Venus and its properties but that does not help support the idea. \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" This quote explains how the risk of exploring and studying Venus was lower \"long ago\" but does not explain or supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. This is not the only way the author does not support the idea successfully. As a question can be the upbringing or curosity and reasoning, the author seems to not give a response to the question on supporting the idea. \"The value of returning to Venuse seems indisputable, but what are the options of making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?\" The athour questions possible options on how to get both saftey and productivity, but does not question the risks and possible dangers of exploring Venus. As the passage continues the author only explains the options and possible ways on exicuting the idea but does not include the risks that the options hold. As the passage is very informative and holds great information, the author supports very poorly the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author explains solutions that are a possobility but does not include the risks of the idea. The author also informs the audience about the history of Venus but boes not help on supporting the idea of studying Venus. The author unfortuntly, poorly supported the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",
    "I do believe that community service is good, especially for young people. It gives them a sense of responsibility, helps them feel better about themselves, and serves the community at the same time. However, I do not believe that it should be required. Some kids already have too much on their plates, with things such as violin, dance, taking care of younger siblings, chores, and more. once you start forcing kids to do community service, it loses some of its meaning. If people are doing it for selfish reasons, then it's just not as sincere. Senior citizens would much rather be helped by nice kids than reluctant teenagers. Of course, kids who do community service often have better chances of getting into better schools. So I believe that community service should stay an optional activity, because if a kid wants to look good on their resume, then they'll have to work extra hard for it. If every teen has community service on their record, then it's just not the same. People who work harder than others deserve to get rewarded. Let's be honest, community service isn't every kids' thing. Sometimes, teenagers are really bad at community service. It's better to let them do their own thing than force them to terrorize elementary school kids. Some teens are better at participating at other things, such as drama club, science fairs, or more. We shouldn't force kids at this age to be more helpful, or charitable, because let me tell you, it most likely won't work. So while I'm in the opinion that community service is a great thing, it should not be abused. Some kids have many reasons not to be able to do community service. It doesn't mean they're heartless monsters, it just means they're busy. Trust me, the kids who actually want to do community service will find a way to do it. My friends are a shining example of that. You don't need to force us to do it, a lot of us will do it on our own. Please have more faith in us.",
    "Community service is important in the country of the\nUntied\nStates. Service in the community can change the place where one is working at.\n Finding community service can be easy It changes the person's character. I think that the principal should make everyone do service in the community.\n The service can change the place where is being done. The place can turn into a cleaner area. The kids of the community would learn that helping can be a good thing.\n The children would learn to not be in gangs.\n Many people's life be changed there will less people getting hurt by gangs.\n There be more people in collage. The whole world will be changed. Finding a community to help can be where you live at. A soup kitchen can be found near a locate church. There can be an old lady living next door that needs help with grocery. Or you can just donate coats to a coat drive in the winter.\n",
    "Do you think asking more than one person for advice is a good idea?\nWell I think it is when you ask people for advice they have been through the same situation. Going to ask for advice from more than one person is important. When you want more advice you should talk to your parents, friends , or a older sibling.\nThe first person you should talk to is your parents because they are way older than you and they have had more experience with these type of situation.\nThey also know you better than anyone would because they have raised you and know what the best way for you is. The last reason you should talk to your parent is because they have most likely gone through this problem before which means that they know what will work the best and what wouldn't work.\nMost of the time when you ask your parents for advice they give you what solves the problem.\nThe second person I would recommend talking to is a trusted friend.\nThey can give you some good advice because you spend almost 6 hours with them at school so they know what happening around you during school.\nThey would also be pretty honest with you because they want to give you advice that is good for you and that would help.\nThe final reason to talk with a friend or friends is because this is someone who you can talk to if you don't want to talk about it with you parents and you want to see what they would say before mentioning it to you parents.\nThe final person I would go talk to is an older sibling.\nI would talk to them because they have been in your shoes many times.\nSo the advice they would give you would help you because it helped them.\nAlso they can keep this away from your parents.\nNot only are they going to give you advice one what you asked them but they can keep it away from your parents until your ready to ask them.\nFinally I would ask an older sibling for advice because they are older for a reason.\nThey most likely are there to help you when you need to so I would use it while you can before they\u00a0either\u00a0leave for college or already have left.\n",
    "The Electoral College is a process of selecting electors to vote for the president. The Electoral College has both its pros and cons, many reasons for it to stay or be abolished. However, it has more reason to stay rather than changing to election by popular vote for the President.\u00a0 The wnning canidate for U.S President should be who's the best rather rather than who's more popular. The Electoral College may not be the most democratic method but, it does create a sense of balance. The Electoral College has equal tran-regional appeal garuntees an outcome Therfore, the Electoral College should not be abolished. The Electoral College garuntees an outcome. With popular voting and a tie could occur. As, Souce 3; \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised methaod of choosing the President\" informs \"The reason is that the winning canidate's share of the Electoral College invariable exceeds his share of the popular vote.\"(18). So the losing canidate could argue that winner isn't who the people want however, it's the political party members who chose the electors. In, Source 1; \"What is the Electoral College?\", it states that \"Each canidate ruinning for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the canidate's political party...\" Therefore, there is no mystery or deciet, each party knows their electors and canidates so the people are the ones who indirectly chose the winner. As a result, the Electoral College promises an undebatabe outcome. Also,the Electoral College doesn't have any prejudice based on region or location. \"The Electoral College requires to have a trans-regional appeal.\" (sorce 3).\u00a0 Therefore, a canidate has to campiaign in all regions, withought just focusing on just one. So every region has an equal oppurtunity and knowledge to be able to vote. Also this way there's a less chance of \"The residents of other reions to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interest, that he really isn't their president.\"(19). That feeling of equality and \"my opinion matters\" is exactly what America is about and this aspect of the Electoral College captures that beautifully. In conclusion, the Electoral college may not be the most democratic way of voting however, it is quite fair.\u00a0 If we only had popular voting canidates would possible just focuse on one are to build a strong support base. This would'nt give every region or person a fair chance and strong word, which is against everything America stands for. Equality is one of the major virtues of America and the Electoral College expresses equality through balance more so than popular vote. The Electoral College garuntees a certaint outcome without debates or tie breakers. It allows every region to have a fair chance in the election by making sure they are well informed and included through the recquirment of trans-regional appeal. For these reasons the Electoral College should not be abolished and changed to popular vote for United States of America. ",
    "I would go with policy number one because something might come up that day at school and the student might need to tell a parent what happened. I wouldn't let the students have the phones all day because that would effect their learning skills They would become hooked to their phone and not listen to their teacher as much. But I would go ahead and have them use their phones through out the day when they are not in classes. Like say it started snowing really bad at school that day and your coach tells you at school that there will be no practice after school. You could call or text your parent ahead of time during school that there is no practice. So it would be more efficient for you and your parent both. Your parent could go home earlier without having to wait for you after practice. I just think that it is important to have your phone at least when your not in class. But sometimes it isn't good to have phones at all in school Like say someone at your school got shot or maybe something very bad happened to someone and your texting and calling your parents, grandparents, friends, and other people about what had happened. Well you and your whole school plus the people your texting and calling all the time. They block the phone station so you cant call the real important people like the hospital or police That would be bad so the there are PROS and CONS about having phones at schools. ",
    "The Face on Mars is one of the most contriversial landforms around. Many people think that it is an artifact that was left behind by past civilizations on Mars. On the other hand, there are people that beleive it is just a mesa, \"landorrms common around the American West.\" There are many people in both parties, making for a huge \"debate.\" The most logical, however, is that the Face is naturally occuring, due to the evidance that NASA has been able to uncover. The people that say it is an ancient civilization use illogical evidance for their conclusions, such as, \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" However, the people that believe it is naturally occuring use stable evidance, including, \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This evidance shows that the best technology we have shows nothing more than, \"a lava dome that takes the form of and isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" Another way to show that the Face on Mars is naturally occuring is the comparison to the lanforms here on Earth, such as the mesa landforms in the American West In the passage, Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist at NASA, working specifically on Mars exploration, is quoted saying,\"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" Garvin, as said before, is a chief scientists at NASA. If he concludes that it is just like a lanform people can see here, than why would anyone be able to argue that? People strive to find out what is in the unknown. Researchers are some of the people that put their lives into getting the best evidance that they can find about the unknown. The Face on Mars is one example of many projects scientists have put time and effort into. They will always find the best solution or answer to whatever the question may be. Why not trust their conclusions?",
    "I believe that we should change the system to \"election by popular vote\". If we were to change the way we elect our president im sure citizens would be more pleased with the over all outcome. People vote on who they think is best fit to represent them and give them the best over all outcome. When using the \"electoral college\" you are not voting for the president but you are voting for a state of electors. It would be easier to simply allow presidents to get the popular vote in order to make the election more fair all around. The \"electoral college\" is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system. It is time to change our voting methods because the \"electoral college\" system is outdated, irrational, and unfair to citizens When people place their vote they belive they are putting in a vote for the president they choose, not for a slate of electors. The \"electoral college\" is a very non-democratic way of selecting your president. In a way the government is deceiving their citizens by the way our voting method is set up. When people vote they feel a sense of independence because they are allowed to choose who they would like to represent them in congress. But instead once they place their vote it goes to electors rather than a simple vote towards the one they selected. If you were to change the way people's votes were counted it would be easier and faster to elect a president and get him into office to fix world-wide problems. \nIn all three articles at least one section has made it clear on their opinion to abolish the electoral college. Figures such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have agreed on abolishing the electoral college When voting for president you are voting for a slate of electors, but do we even know who these supposed electors are! Are votes are being manipulated and we are not even aware of who is doing it. If we can not vote for are president without going through electors we should be able to vote for the electors who are voting for are president. It is only fair that we have some say in everything that is going on. When votes are being placed we should be informed of all that is going on. If you were to vote for your favorite tv show but your vote had to go through twenty different people all with different opinions you would be frustrated. Now imagine that scenario but with something extremely more significant than a televison show, the president. You are trusting possibly the next four years of your life with strangers in which you have never heard of before. It would only be fair if we could simply change the system to popular vote rather than electoral college. If you switch to popular vote more people would be more likely to vote because they could have more confidence about their vote. They would feel free to make their own decision and trust it would not be tampered with by a stranger. People deserve a fair vote and with the popular vote that is what you are giving them. Because every living being deserves equality. Changing the system would not only be helpful for citizens but helpful for the congress. Instead of having random members of congress choose the president they can work on serious issues around the world. They can stop worrying about foolishness and do their jobs. In conclusion changing the way people vote is easier for everybody. It saves time for electors and it gives people a chance to see who they are really voting for. Presidents would have to go to each state and appeal to them in order to get a vote. I belive that is what we need. They would be required to actually work for a position in office rather than speaking on whjat they are going to do and paying someone else to elect them. We should have faith in our president and know who we are voting for before we cast our vote. This system seems more fair and more modern to the twenty first century. This is a system most Americans would agree with. ",
    "When you first hear of this new software you may not see a need for such technology to exist. However, once you take a look into what this exciting software is capable of, you might actually grow into the idea I believe that this software could just end up being a helpful resource used in everyday life. If executed in the correct manners, I believe that this software could be an incredible resource that serves many different purposes Not too long ago, technology became an everyday tool in schools around the globe. If new software such as this was implemented into devices we used at school, as a student I believe that I would benefit from it greatly. The author used the example predicted by Dr. Thomas Huang of a student who is getting bored or confused. The device could potentially produce a pop-up providing help or motivation and encouragement.\n This software could be put introduced to many ways of life. For example, self-checkout stations and bank ATM's. If you appear to need help you will provided with assistance. It could potentially be a major improvement for costomer service. Software like this would definitely take getting used to, but would be worth it in the end if we are optimistic enough. Another possibility would be for this software to be used while using serach engines If you appear to not be satisfied, you will be directed to a page of new results. Perhaps if you show interested in certain results but not others, you could get a page of new result compiled of just the results you seemed interested in. Similar to the example of web ads appearing on your screen given to us by the author. I believe that this software could end up being a very important feature in technology. This technology may not be very extensive yet. However, it definitely has potential. It could be implemented into many regions of everyday life. I think that the possibilities are endless. ",
    "Driverless cars are exaclty what you would expect them to be. Cars that will drive without a person actually behind the wheel controlling the actions of the vehicle. The idea of driverless cars going in to developement shows the amount of technological increase that the wolrd has made. The leader of this idea of driverless cars are the automobiles they call Google cars. The arduous task of creating safe driverless cars has not been fully mastered yet. The developement of these cars should be stopped immediately because there are too many hazardous and dangerous events that could occur. the driver will be alerted when they will need to take over the driving responsibilites of the car. This is such a dangerous thing because we all know that whenever humans get their attention drawn in on something interesting it is hard to draw their focus somewhere else. The article explains that companies are trying to implement vibrations when the car is in trouble. Their are some people out there who do not feel vibrations and therefore would not be able to take control of the car when needed. The article also states that companies are trying to put in-car entertainment into the car while it is being driven. This is just another thing that will distract the person who is supposed to be ready at all times to take over driving when asked to do so. Another thing that can go wrong with these cars is any type of techological malfucntion. Every person with any kind of technological device has experienced some sort of error. Now imagine if your car has an error technologically and it takes the life of one your loved ones. The article talks about sensors around the car that read the surroundings of the car and that is what helps he car to drive without a true driver behind the wheel. Those sensors could have a malfunctions and be sensing something that is that even there and make a left turn into a 100 foot deep lake. The vibrations that cause the driver to be notified to drive could malfunction and now the driver has no way of knowing that the car is in trouble and now you, the driver, and the rest of your passengers are being buried in your local cemetery. who to blame for the wreck if there were possibly some sort of technological malfunciton or even some sort of human error when taking over the driving aspect. Should the manufacturer of the car be blamed or should it be the driver? No one knows because there is so many different factors that attribute to who to assign the blame to. Some of what will have to be made is a judgement call. When it comes to insurance and having to pay for any damages you do not want someone to have to make some sort of judgement call. What if that judgement call that was made was the wrong call? Now there are going to be even more lawsuits today in our courts than there already are. This problem alone will just lead to many more issues today in the world that should not have to be dealt with. With all these things that could possibly go wrong with these driverless cars there is no way that the developement of them should continue any further. In today's society if something bad COULD happen or something COULD go wrong, it WILL happen, and it WILL go wrong. There are just way too many safety hazards that come along with these driverless cars. Becuase of all of these problems that arise with the cars it is just a gargantuan risk to implement these cars into our lifestyles. ",
    "Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Taking eyes off the road while driving is one of the first lessons that is taught to a driver in his early driver's education. Drivers who talk while driving do not pay attention to road and thus end up in an accident. They put not only their life in danger but other drivers and pedestrians. Text messaging while driving is a bigger danger than talking on a phone while driving While texting, the drivers have to completely divert their attention from road to their cell phone and their hands from the steering wheel to the cell phone.\n Hands free devices are used to avoid accidents, but recent studies shows it is in the leading cause of accidents cell phone car chargers force the driver to take both of his hands off the steering wheel to car charger and cell phone and thus loses control of vehicle and putting life in danger.

    "Everyone has an opinion, some are helpful, yet others just are going to make your life worse. You might ask why anyone would care about someone else's opinion, well it's hard to answer that question. You see, having multiple opinions can help limit the bias from the first opinion you received. Thus, why wouldn't you want to have multiple opinions, well it's quite simple, it's because people in our world are too scared to ask for others opinion or their advice. When asking for advice you are receiving wisdom, this wisdom can guide you to many great things, or it could lead you to absolute disaster. You will be guided into doing the wrong things in your life however you could stop all of that with a bit of advice. Having an opinion from one person can be very helpful, but just imagine if you could see both sides of your problem, thus leading you to obtain enough information on your problem and make the right choice. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice wisdom from those around you is helpful, it will help limit bias, two opinions is always better than one. Bias, bias is a thing no one should want in the opinions they are receiving. It is never a good choice to make to accept a biased opinion as a truth. Staying away from a biased opinion will benefit in so many unbelievable ways one could be eliminating the untruthful opinions from your life. It can be very unhelpful as well, these biased opinions could lead you down a road you should not go down. You can have a very bright future awaiting for you, but the one bias opinion you listen to can and will destroy your life. You might ask how could it destroy your life in an instant, well people will look at you differently based off the one bad biased opinion you listened to, and building that former life you previously\u00a0had will virtually be impossible. Wisdom is\u00a0one of the most important things you will ever receive. Wisdom can be received or given by anyone such as your peers and elders. Everyone you meet will always have a choice to make therefore for every choice you have to make daily will effect your life forever. Some however will not be as big as others deciding what you will have fir dinner is no where as big of a decision as what you will do when your house burns down or you lose your job. It you have two opinions you will be able to see both sides of the problem therefore making it easier to for you to make the right choice. Having only one opinion is definitely worse than having multiple because you are unable to have the option to see the other side. The one opinion could lead you into making some wrong choices, yet have multiple will lead to make some of the better choices that you could have made. Having the most opinions possible could change your life for the better, and possibly make your life easier. Although, receiving multiple opinions could sound easy it is quite difficult, due to the fact that nit everyone is going to want to help you. Some people in our world will not want you to succeed. However one opinion is worse than having multiple because you are unable to see everything that could be harmful towards you. Obtaining multiple opinions for your problem is helpful for making the right choice because personal experience or wisdom is helpful, helps take away biased opinions, and multiple opinions from others is always better than one opinion. Who would care about others opinions, finding the answer will be almost impossible. Multiple opinions can limit the bias you have previously been given. Why would you even want to obtain opinions from others if they are all bad, well that's not true, opinions from others can be good for you to listen to. Wisdom form others should be a big part in the choices you make. However, you will have to be sure that they persons' opinion you are listening is trying to help you. Opinions come in two forms good and bad however you must do everything in your power to only listen to the good and not harmful opinions. ",
    "The use of technology is getting advanced more and more as each day goes on. So by now we should be able to know is Mona Lisa was smiling or not. Now these days technology is informational and often true so why shouldnt we belive the results. In the first paragraph its states she is 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery. By looking at the painting you would probaly belive that because she is smiling, she couldve been fearful because she didnt know Leonardo da Vinci, and she couldve been angery because at the time she wouldve had to be sitting there for hours until he finished or he would have to start all over. In the passage tehy dop have good evidence if you studied anatomy you would be able to understand how all the facial expressions work. They even claim that da Vinci studieed anatomy which helped him paint her facial muscle precisely. They even teach you how to make the same face she made in the painting. Based of the information they staed in the passage i do believe that the teachnology called Facial Action Coding System can identify human emotion.",
    "Is Venus a worthy pursuit despite the danger, I say no because Venus is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 thimes greater than what we had to experience on planet Earth. First the text states \u00a8 These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth, such an enviorment wuld crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.\u00a8(Paragraph 3) The quote is saying is event though our planet can mealt things Venus can mealt is a lot faster than Earth can. \n Then the test also states \u00a8Venus has the hottest surface temperatures of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freguent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.\u00a8(Paragraph 3) The test is saying even though Mercury is the closet planet to the sun Venus has the highest preasure and heat and Benusin geology and weather presents additional impendiments like valcanos, earthquakes, and freguent lighting so it? hard for scienetist to land rockests on Venus. So when you asked me if Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers My anwser will still my no because there are still thing on Venus we don know about.

    "The main advantages to limiting car usage would be less accedents and less polution. to start off with cars can make you very tense and then posibly resulting in a crash. Without cars people would be less tense and be calm every day as they go to work. For example Heidrun Walter said \" When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. \" In the outskirts of freiburg street parking, drive ways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely car free except for the main thoroghfare. Freiburg does allow car ownership but there are only two places to park, large garrages at the edge of the develoupment, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. As a result 70% of the people do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to be able to live there. People now walk, take the tram, or ride bicycles to school and work, and yet these people are very happy about it. Planes are now taking this concept to the suburbs. They are doing this by putting new building walking distance from those people insted of the malls were people have to drive in order to get there. in addition to people being less tense banning cars would result in less polution.\u00a0 Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. After five days of smog rivaled china which is one of the most poluted cities of the world. Diesels were the blame. But finally on monday the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescid the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuseday. This ban also went on to Colombia for three years they have been doing this and they only allow buses and taxies everyone else\u00a0 gets a $25 fine. Eventually two other colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event. kids now are not even wanting to get a drivers license they would rather walk. these kids get their jobs by looking at the ones that are in walking distance. this is a very good thing because the less drivers the less pollution there is in the air. in conclusion if we limited the usage of cars people would be more relaxed and there would be less polution in the air pluss people would be gatting exercise so people would benifit from this and our world would be much cleaner.",
    "As a student enrolled in public schools I have had various experinces where I felt that I didn't fit in; or felt severe levels of stress and anxiey. I am now a junior in highschool and have now gotten somewhat used to what is required of me in a public school. If the the privilage of taking online classes would have been offered to me I wouldn't have lost my personality and mental health to the society that is seen in public schools. Now, that the oppurtunity of enrolling in classes online and studying from home is an option; people that feel that they wouldn't be able to handle the society in public schools now have another way to look. The concept that students may benefit from taking classes at home is valid they would be able to achieve more focus and concentration they would experince less stress and anxiety; thus strengthening their mental health. Students may benefit from taking classes at home because they could gain more focus and concentration. There are some people who concentrate better when studying alone. These students enrolled in online classes may be more focused because they are in a more comfortable environment, which is their home. They will learn more because they don't have to wake up as early as people that go to public schools. They also wouldn't have to worry much about their apperance such as what they're going to wear, how their hair needs to be styled, how to hide their eyebags, if they need make up on, and what shoes to put on. They could also perform better academically because they have the oppurtunity of starting thier classes later. Having enough hours of sleep benefits students because it allows the brain to function at its full potential. The students could feel more enthusiastic about school because they don't have to listen to a teacher tell them what they can and can't do. Students will benefit from taking classes from their homes in the form of having better mental health. Every human being at some point during their lifetime experinces the feeling of being nervous, anxious, or stressed. Most students experince this when they have to present themselves or a project infront of a class full of other students. Their anxiety rises especially in these situations because they feel like they're being judged or scrutinized. To add to their stress and anxiety the students have to deal with other students, teachers, and various homework assignments. They could also lose their personalities to the society found in public schools. Students often lose who they truly are when they are under an immense amount of pressure. Which leads to their mental health decreasing drastically.\n Some may argue that student may become isolated if they take classes at home. Those that argue that claim may also think that student who take classes at home may lack communication skills, which are essential for the future. Others can also say the some students aren't ready to take on resonsibility that comes with taking classes online. Overall, enrolling in classes that you are able to take at home can benefit students in the long run because they will feel less pressured. Their mental health would be strong and they would have a strong sense of self. They would also perform better because they would get the necessary amount of hours that a person needs to function properly.",

    "Today in society we have alot of disagreements on which president should be elected on the day all votes are finally counted and the votes are tallied up to the final result of who is going to be our new president of the United States, but what is our system for doing this?\nOne way is\nElectoral College,\nElectoral college is a process consisted of thye selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the votes from congress. So if you think about it we are just electors for electors. This College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 votes can win the election for the President. Under the Electoral college, voters dont vote for the president, they vote for state electors who in turn elect the president. There are many veiw points of the Electoral College, but most would decied that its unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions whithout much basis in reality. People want to have their vocies hear for the country they live in, they want an opinion that matters!

    "People should agree that the face on Mars was probably an accident. The face probably was not a face, it could have been another Martian mesa. A rock os some type could have hit it or a meteor could also. Next, NASA took pictures of it, and NASA was researching it and studying it, so they can get more information on it. After studying it, they took a picture of it, and they engaged the public with it. People started to have debates about the picture and what it could have ment. \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence pof life on Mars.\" The others are trying to protect it so NASA could be a little bit safer. The picture did look like an Egyptian Pharaoh NASA said it was a \"huge rock information\" because it is very similar to a human's face. Next, you cannot just asumed the planet was made from aliens because there is a human's face on it. You got to study the artifact before you can assume it is from aliens. After that, you got to be able to back up your answer , and saying why it is not a face. \"Thousands of anxious web sufers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform.\" People can asume it is a human's face because it look likes it. Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars. Also the rock or the artifact does have an Egyptian Pharoah, it could mean a human was at one point up there. It probably is possible to have civilization on Mars. In conclusion, the artifact could have just been hit by a rock. People need to belive most things that are not really true. ",
    "The idea of having driverless cars is something that brings many questions in my head such as how safe they will be and how they will improve our atmosphere. In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" they bring up many good ideas about driveless cars and some ideas that I just plain out think would'nt be good for our world at all. In my retrospect after reading \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" I feel as though these driveless cars would be an amazing idea to contribute to our community. These cars would benefit our community in many ways not just for our safety but for our atmosphere. Having driverless cars would impact our safety in many ways such as reducing accidents on the streets. Having these driverless cars would reduce car accidents because the driverless car would have laser beams to constantly update the surroundings of the car such as the other cars making it safer for humans to drive. Not only would the human be aware of his or her surroundings but the computer would be tracking the safety too which would help even more while driving.\nIn paragraph four of \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\"\nit states \" it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings\". Driveless cars would also have antilock brakes which would be provided in these cars incase of rollovers and skids. According to the article of \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" it states \"automakers used speed sensore at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. Within 10 years,those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or roll overs\". These cars would help our safety of everyone in many ways possible. These cars would help our atmosphere with all the pollution that we as humans make everyday The tank for these driverless cars would only use half of what a normal car uses today. This would reduce our pollution by a dramatic decrease and it would help nature and many of the animals but most importantly us. In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" it states \"The cars he foresees would use half of the fuel of today's taxis\". Just imagine a cleaner world for everyone. These cars would help make our world a cleaner,greener and greater place to live in. The awsome thing about these cars is that it would only make us drive in bad traffic,working zones and around accidents. But the car would announce before we are needed just to be aware. Not many times will the car need someone to be in control over it. It would introduce the problem way ahead of time due to its GPS that the car will include. You will be able to most likely avoid these problems before you even get to them. I believe these cars would be a huge bonus to our community. Not only in safety but as well as our enviroment and our world. It would gives us a better world to live in and maybe a safe one too if everything goes well as plan. These cars are the future and will make our future better than ever before.",
    "Have you ever been confused on how the president is elected from two huendred and sevendy votes when you see more than a that many poeple a day Well I'm not because I can't vote, but I do think that the Electoral College should stay in action.\u00a0 People may not like the Electoral College because it isn't there vote that really dessideds the winner of the eletion. I am in favor for the Electoral College because it does help us out even if we don't always see it. The Electoral College helps us by avioding run-off elctions, where the votes are too close to desside a clear winner. It does this by in most states the majority of the popular votes dessides where all the votes go.\u00a0 \"That pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.\"(Posner)\u00a0 In the 2012 election the populor vote in Florida was very close and if the president was dessided form the popular vote Floride would have had little effect on the eletion, but since the Electoral College dessides the winner, Obama had tweinty nine more votes to his campaign.\u00a0 \"Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all the winning presidental candidate.\"(the Office of the Federal Register) Some people may thing that the Electoral College sould be done away with so that the president can be dessided by popular votes. If this were to happen then there would be the chance to have run-off elections, since there would be no clear winner if the votes were very close.\u00a0 There would be the complete unbalance from state to state, Rhode Island would have little to no effect on the election, where as with the Electoral College it could be the state to choose the winner. The Electoral College keeps it so that each state has a bigger impact on the election and saves us from run-off elections from a close number of votes.\u00a0 If we didn't have the Electoral College in place then history would be different for better or for worse, but I think that the Electoral College should be here to stay.

    "Almost all students love Summer vacation. But this time out of school is also a major halt in leaning. This halt can cause students to fall out of the rhythm of daily learning and cause them to forget material taught during the previous school year. This is why schools started implementing Summer projects to keep students engaged in learning. Summer projects have been traditionally designed by teachers but some people argue that students should be designing these projects. Teachers should be designing the Summer projects they know more about the material, they would make it challenging enough, it would be an easy and simple process. \n One reason teachers should be designing the Summer projects is because they know more about the material. Many of these teachers have been teaching this information for a couple years. This means that these teachers have a good idea of what the students know from this school year and what information they should be prepared for in the coming school year. This information would greatly aid in making the Summer projects because the teachers would know how to format it in a way that students are familiar with but also prepares them for the new information that will be presented in the next school year.\u00a0This would be very helpful to kids because it sets them up for success in the next year. Another reason why teachers should be designing the Summer projects is because they would make it challenging enough. If kids tried to create a Summer project, it would most likely result in an easy assignment that would take no effort. This would destroy the entire purpose of the summer assignment and give no benefit to the student. But if teachers designed it, then it would more likely be a project of an acceptable rigor. The projects needs to be challenging enough that it keeps kids engaged in learning so they will benefit from it. \n The last reason teachers should be designing the Summer projects is because it would be a easy and simple process If a couple teachers get together and make the Summer project it would be easy for them to make a rubric to go along with it. If the students make the Summer project then it would be much more of complicated .\nThe students\u00a0would most likely have to brainstorm ideas and pick one for the project which would take time, then pitch the idea to the teachers and wait for approval, and then after all that is done the teachers have to use a project that they did not make to create a rubric for grading. This seems like a lot of extra work when it could easily be simplified by the teachers creating the project. Some people may argue that if the kids design the project they will be more engaged and willing to complete it, but the pros of teachers creating the project definitely outweigh the cons. Summer projects are extremely helpful and important to students learning experience. This is why it is so important that these projects are well constructed and thought out. Considering all this, it is clear that the best people to complete the task of creating these projects are teachers. ",
    "The use of this technology for a classroom full of students will not be valuable. Although it would be interesting to see what the students are feeling during a lesson. How is the data going to be of use in science? The students can express their feelings, but what are the researchers going to do with this information. This technology should be used, but not in the classroom. If we do end up using the system to detect emotions where will the data go. It will help the video game industry with the evidence from paragraph 6 \"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery.\" Why only put this into a classroom put it into the robots we are building today so they seem more human-like, so they can become more advanced than a ordinary robot The direction the researchers are taking are great, but the choice of where to put it needs to be different. Just putting it into a classroom would be a waste of time and money. There is so much wasted potential if the system is put into a classroom.\nwe could use this technology for bigger and better things. For instance better facial recognition security systems so it can be more accurate reading faces and does not open or let in anyone that looks like the person. Or lock the person out of anything that is protected by facial recognition. Another example of how this could be useful in other ways is the facial recognition can be used in the police force to find a match of a person that was caught on camera to be tracked down and captured. The way that the researchers are using it for is inefficient and wasteful and should not be implemented in classrooms. ",
    "I think you should require all students to perform community service because many students laze around with nothing to do, when they could be helping the community. Many kids who are bored tend to get caught up in bad things , such as gangs, drugs, and violence. In requiring kids to perform community service, you are preventing them from doing bad things, you are giving them something to do after school and you are helping them help the community. I walk around my community to see kids fighting, doing drugs, stealing, and other bad things Many kids are bored after school , with nothing to do , no friends to play with, so they sit around and get fat and lazy. They could make the community a better place, by cleaning up trash , and helping the community stay a nice, safe, and clean place. So , I think you should require kids to perform community service, because it would be good for them AND the community. ",
    "I would like to say i think this policy is uncalled for, and i think students should be able to play in sports or other activities if they have a c or better I mean it's not like their failing or anything.

If students don't have a c or better then they could not play in sports or other activities. I also think that it would be highly unfair if students wouldn't be able to play in sports with a c or better. Some students love to play basketball, football, or even volleyball, and if they wouldn't be able to play with a c i bet they would be highly upset. Students try their best in the classrooms to get their work done, and to get a good grade. So I say that this policy shouldn't be past on to students.",

Your friends call you and ask you what happened. Did something go wrong? Did we miss any extra votes last night?\u00a0 You go look at the votes, they are still the same.\u00a0 Then you relize that the Electoral College did not care what the people of this country said.

And I know that many other people in this country would agree. I think that is should be changed to the popular vote for the President of the United States. As you can see, for the past few elections, there has been a lot of contriverse with how the votes turned out.\u00a0 Many people don't agree with the decisions that the College makes in the elections.\u00a0 In the Artical, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" says, that the electors can be anyone not holding public office.

    "I dissagree with the people who say that this landform on Mars was created by aliens. While there is little evidence to prove that this could have been made by aliens, there is much more evidence to disprove those people. By taking in what the landform looks like where it is an how clearly the picture taken was, it is very easy to tell that this was not created by aliens The first reason is that the \"Face\" isn't even a face. People only thought it was before because that is what the picture showed them. Now, with higher resolution pictures, it is very clear that this is not a face. It is a mesa. Another fact to prove that this is a mesa, is the region that it was found in Cydonia is a region on Mars that mesas are very commonly found in. If the face was some kind of landform, it would make sense to be a mesa taking into consideration of what it looks like and what region it is in. Some people might argue that you cannot see the face clearly since it s usually very cloudy over that region. Well on April 8, 2001, a spacecraft went over the face on a clear day and got a picture. Because of the resolution of the picture, if there were any sort of planes or pyramid-like buildings, they would be very easy to see. So, there are the facts. The landform looks like a mesa. You can tell by the high resolution picture that was taken. And it is in Cydonia, a region full of mesas. If you take those facts and piece them together, it is very easy to tell that this is a mesa not a monument made by aliens. ",

    "Student-designed summer projects would be more beneficial than teacher-designed Students will have a wide variety of options to choose from Freedom to expresss themselves their resources will be known. Back then when I was in 4th grade almost every other weekend my aunt would take my cousin,brother and I to this frozen yougurt place in Generic_City. The place was called frozen frog or something like that and we would just try all of the flavors when we got a chance it was amazing but we only could fill up the cup plus the toppings that we wanted,so we went ahead and made our choices and we said we would try something new the next time we went to that shop. Just like students we had the choice to do what we wanted to pick and get it done without someone else telling me to do what they wanted us to do. When I first started playing Mortal Kombat 11. I was so excited to try out all the new and old characters and see what new things they can do. I told myself I want to try and use different characters than the ones I use constantly. So I do so and realize that I never really play with Generic_Name or Generic_Name for some reason but then when I tried using them in a real fight it never really worked out. So I had convinced myself that it was all because I never learned their moves but then something hit me it wasn't that i haven't mastered their moves in such a small amont of time it was because their moves were just the same as Mortal Kombat X and I am not really good at working with close ranged fighters. My specialty was at fighting with those who can attack at any distance. Zoners were my best bet at winning any match. Also like students allowing people to see their limits can help others know what they are good at and what they aren't and they won't feel troubled because of a few minor things that were out of their control stop them from doing their job. Truthfully it is just another way to tell someone no to doing this or that or it is a continuation of limiting people on their creativity. Back in 6th grade most people had a problem with the art tecaher because she had such strict rules in a way it was either her way or the highway. No one could really understand why she had us doing things this way or that way. With that being said everyone was hoping that one day she would actually miss a day and one day she called out but then I looked around me everyone was having a fun time because they could express themselves through their art. All students need to be able to express themselves without having someone telling them that they are doing things wrong. some people might say that is not true and if we allow students to do whatever they feel like doing then how are we suppose to make them do anything educational and how do you think it is going to help them in life. allow some type of creativity in their life because you cannot tell me that you expect students to be told later on in the future to do this and this tep by step. That is never gonna happen no one is ever gonna hold another persons hand all the days of their life thta is why they need a bit of freedom =now so they can have some experience with it when they get older. Allow studnets to have freedom in their life without having to be forced to do things,Students will have a wide variety of options and their limits are know through their experiences. ",

Cars are not good for the environment, the pollution from the cars is destorying everything That is why people are limiting their usage of the cars. I am going to tell the advantages of limiting your car usage. In paris they banned people from driving their cars because of the smog. They enforced this ban to clear the air of the global city. They alos said if anyone is driving they would have to pay a fin of 22-euro which is 31 dollors. The smog cleared enough on monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban.

    "The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" tries to explain the several complications of sending a mission to Venus. They provide tons of factual evidence about the geography and climate of Venus. They give many good points, but ultimately fail at their task to convince readers that Venus exploration is worth it. Along with a failed point, this author tends to go off on side-tangents that have minimal importance to the story. The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is an article about the positives and negatives of trying to land a spacecraft on Venus. He has a decent build-up into his first point while giving more and more small facts about our second planet. Venus is likely the most similar planet to Earth, with its rocky surface, hills, and mountains, but it has much more limiting factors to deter us from traveling there. It has terrible weather in comparison to Earth, with acidic carbon dioxide filling 97% of the atmosphere and with heats of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The authors gives plenty of information about this planet, most of it relevant to the topic at hand, and therefore succeeds in teaching you about Venus. Even after succeeding in information given, the author fails to promote the idea that travel to Venus is worth all the cons. They write about NASA wanting to know as much as possible about one of our closest neighbors, but don't give enough reasons as to why it's worth it. With acidic atmospheres ripping through machinery, technologies don't stand a chance on the Venusian surface. With the science that we have, the most we can hope for is a jet-like expirience, flying several miles above surface so that the pressure doesn't crush us instantly. Venus is additionally prone to constant volcanoes, earthquakes, and storms deadly enough to take out machinery. Given all this information, it seems like the author is trying to deter us from missions to Venus instead of promoting it, as they planned. The final point to take into consideration when reading this article is the authors' side-tangents Multiple times, the author delves into a side-topic as opposed to continuing on with the topic of Venus exploration. They start off the article with two sentences that have no relation to the story, yet confuse readers. The sentences are about Venus' nickname, the \"Evening Star\", and how even though it is a planet, it is still called this. This is completely irrelevant to exploration, as everyone knows it is a planet, and the \"Evening Star\" name is never mentioned again. Later on in the passage, the author rambles on about World War II-age computers and how they functioned properly even before the digital age. Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus. Overall, this article about Venus is less than \"stellar\". The author attempts to prove why Venus missions are a neccesity, but doesn't quite get their point across. They provide great knowledge and information, despite being off-topic occasionally. This article is full of great facts, but the delivery is off and could have potentially been a better read if the author was on the other side of the argument, which has more proof to back it up.

    "People all around the world go through different things, but it's those who are there with you that help guide the way In times of a tough decision, seeking multiple opinions will help in making a better choice Everyones opinion\u00a0gives a different point of view and can help pick out what decision is best As well as, some people have gone through similar things and can help talk out the situation In my lifetime I have experienced my friend go through a rough path. Because of the people who helped her, she is now happier and living much better. Many people will have different perspectives. They all can influence a decision, because everyone is\u00a0different. We are raised by our culture and environment. Therefore, no two minds are alike. Situations are seen differently, giving an abundance of different solutions. Imagine a parent and friend helping out the same person, now compare the two. As a parent they want what's best for their child and try to look to steer them in the right direction. While a friend may want the same thing, but at the end of the day they are looking to have fun and may not always give the best advice. When people are getting someone else's a opinion they are making themselves vulnerable to the fact that different possibilities could happen. People can get strongly judged or rejected on their opinions they've made, as that could heavily impact a choice. However, getting multiple views on a decision is always the best option, because everyone sees things differently. Throughout our life people have been through hardships. Some may be similar situations which include ways it's been dealt with in hopes of others making better choices. With the help of someones past, it can help pave a way for someones decision. Knowing peoples mistakes and consequences can differ what others choose to do. When making a choice some people visit professionals. A few include psychologists, therapists and counselors, they help listen to a problem in hopes of breaking it down and seeking best possible outcomes. These people are there to help drive a path for healthy decision making. Another reason is that knowing other people struggle with things too and that no one is ever alone. It provides at least a little comfort understanding everyone goes through something. Those people who decide to open up about their problems can also help determine a choice. Most people care for the well-being of people in hopes for a successful and enjoyable life Talking to people who have dealt with similar problems or people who are professionally trained, can help bring ease to making a decision. At one point in life everyone has gone through or knows someone who has been through a tough decision. A couple years ago I had a friend who always gave advice to everyone's\u00a0problems. She was beautiful, intelligent and fun to be around. However, she did not feel this way about herself. As time went on some situations became too heavy to handle, the stress grew on top of her. At school she only showed perkiness, meanwhile, she was in a darker place. No one was aware of this until a few weeks later when she spoke to her friends, then counselors, next teachers and eventually her parents to get the help she wanted. She was afraid of what the world would think of her if she wasn't perfect. These people all helped her find ways for comfort and how to get the treatment needed without doing something harmful to herself or others. She was steered back into a safe and happy pathway thanks to the help of those around her. To finish off, when seeking multiple opinions it can help someone make a better choice. As said in paragraph one, throughout life people have different views on situations and how to resolve them beneficially. As restated in paragraph two, people in life are faced with many challenges. Knowing others struggle can help bring together different ways to handle a decision. Lastly, when my peer was faced with a problem she sought out help, this brought her to a happier place. She is now better than she ever thought she could be. Making a decision shouldn't be done alone, we need to use the people around us to help guide our journey. ",
    "I think that kids should be allowed to use cell phones during free time in school. Cell phones provide a way of communicating with your parents and other people you need to talk to.\nIf you forgot something or you need something for after school activities, you can just call your parents to bring the things you need to school. Also if there was a lock-in at school, you can call your parents to inform them that you're okay and everything is fine. In addition if you want to go to your friend's house and you need your parents to sign a slip to let you go on your friends bus, they can just bring it to school.\nWhen you are not feeling well and you feel the need to go home, you call your parents to let them know you are not feeling that well. \n Although you can use the school's phone, it is much easier for kids to just use their phones. \n We can still keep the rule of \"green zones\" and \"red zones\" for allowing phone use in the classroom. \nIf it is a \"green zone\", you are allowed to have your phone on and use it for any purposes, but if it is a \"red zone\", you are supposed to have your phone turned off or on silent in your pocket.\nBut the teacher of the classroom is in control of the \"zones\".\nThe teacher may let his/her students use cell phones during study center or for any activity their doing. \n You can still keep the consequences of having your cell phone out during class. \nFirst time is giving the phone to your teacher until the end of class, second time is a call to your parents, and third time is a trip to your office with the student's parents. \n \nCell phones are just a good way of communicating.\nI know that you can trust SCHOOL_NAME\nstudents about being responsible and to not take advantage of the cell phones.\nPlease take the note of consideration of keeping cell phones in SCHOOL_NAME. \n",
    "I will be talking to you about how scientist's are thinking of putting things on the planet Venus and i wll also talk to you the fasinated thing our planet Venus has to offer. Well Venus is sometimes called a Evening Star. It's so bright that young stargazer would be able to find it. Venus is very hard to get a good look at, it's the second planet from the sun. It's name can be misleading, and the planet is refrred to earth as our \" twin\" plaents. We haven't been able to send a spacecraft over there yet because of the fact that the stuff we send over there are not able to survive for less than an hour. Scientist's have onle been able to send robots and teven they can't find a safe landing sight.\nThe clouds on Venus very corrosive since they have sulfruic acid in them. The air is also 97 percent carbon dioxide. The planet also has the hostest surface, it's tempurature can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric preasure is also 90 times greater than Earth's, but despite the planets dangers it would be a worthy pursuite. For example the planets atmospheric preasure is so strong that it crush a submarine that can go into the deepest part of the ocean.\nScientist's are fascinated by the planets Earth-like apperence. They think that long ago there use be a form of life that could have been very much Earth-like. The main reasonfor why astronomer's are so fascinated by Venus is because it looks very much like Earth. For example it has valleies, river bank's, and even mountains. Scientist's are thinking of sending a blimp like aircraft that can fly or hover at least 30 if not higher miles the planet's surface. The tempurature would range around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The best part would be that there is plenty is solar power.\n",
    "The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable in some ways and some not because a computer knowing when your happy or sad could be beneficial in your classroom. For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad will follow. But if you frown, the next ad wll be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. But I bet your lab partner could recognize if you are happy, sad, or mad. Its all about muscular action units. They indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile. In a real smile the muscles that begin at your cheek bones lift the corners of your mouth. In a false smile, the mouth is strecthed sideways. Muscle clues are sometimes important. Which is why I think that this technology is better off not being useful in classes because you can detect a person being happy, sad, or mad by yourself by muscle clues. To an expert, faces dont lie.

    "Why do people get multiple opinions instead of just one? The answer is simple. Multiple opinions are better than one for many reasons, it is good to hear all sides of the story, two heads are better than one, having multiple opinions helps you find the right answer. Why should we listen to all sides of the story? Wouldn't it be better to just know one and stick with it? No! hearing all of the sides of a story helps you form better opinions and ideas You can combine your ideas and opinions to make better, more thought out ideas. Hearing all sides of the story is also way more fair than only listening to one person and refusing to listen to any one else. If you do that, then how will you know if the choice you made is the right choice? Can you live with yourself forever knowing that you made the wrong decision? Working together is better and easier than trying to do everything yourself. If you do that, you could try to do to much. If you do that, then you will never be able to catch up. Working together can fix that. If you work in a group, or just with a partner, you can get things done twice as fast. When working together you can make better ideas for how to do something. You can bounce back ideas and improve them. Working together can help you solve problems faster. Working with others is definitely better than trying to do everything alone.\n Having multiple opinions can help you find the right opinion. No matter how much you are like someone, no matter how much you agree, you can not agree on everything. Two people can never be exactly alike. So you can't always get only one opinion from only one person. They might always give good advice and opinions, but sometimes their opinions are not right for you. You have to remember that you are your own person, and that sometimes things are right for other people, but they are not always right for you. You can talk it through with others and find a decision that is right for everyone. Talking decisions through can help you consider all possible options. Asking lots of people their opinion and why they think that can help you make a good design, but do not just do what everyone else did. You have to do what is best for you. Getting multiple opinion can help you make better choices. You should hear all sides of the story, work in groups, and get multiple opinion to find the right decision for you. These things will help you make the best choice. Try them, and you will make great decisions. The only thing you have to do is get multiple opinions.\u00a0",
    "The principle wants all students to take at least one extracurricular\u00a0activity I agree with the principle having one will help you real under stand to manage your time wisely,and it can help you under stand how you spend your time. My opinion is if he makes this a requirement for students will have a better\u00a0chance to succeed in the real world with what they learned for example managing,and learning the value of time will help you make the right chooses. One reason I agree with the principle is that studies have shown that have done a extracurricular are the most likely to succeed\u00a0in life cause they have learned the too most important things in life to me is what you should use your. Time on or what is worth your time not much people know this Second reason I agree is that time is priceless it is not infinite people dont know how much time they really have therefor its better to make the best of it before its all gone therefor the people who have chosen to use there time. Wisely they have much more time cause they have done what they had to do getting more time but it docent mean the people around them will get the same cause they chose there path and they chose there toured success. By choosing that path they have chosen there future\u00a0which docent really change unless there has been a large impact like death or courage to do what ever it takes to succeed no mater what any body says to try to turn you down. Final reason is managing time is what you need for jobs therefor if you are learning it early own the essayer it is,and to lost of people this is a great skill to have therefor this quality will get you many jobs since you know how to. Work your schedule therefor there work on time team projects have time on your schedule and someone cant make it they type of people often\u00a0help out and get promotion or get played into a low payed job but that docent really happen often. Sincerly,therefor if the princple dicidcides to make having a elxctoal activity a requirment he or she is leading students to succeed in th future if all schools do this etheir their will be less poverty or more students passing by the years will drop out which do the people choice?",
    "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their time away from school. these summer projects be student-designed instead of teacher-designed. it tells the teacher what the student actually learned throughout the school year makes the student go at their own pace instead of feeling rushed.\n Having a student design their own project shows what they have learned throughout the school year. If a teacher was to design a project for a class of students, most of them will not even try. Most of them would try to find ways to finish the project without showing that they had learned anything during the school year. But having a student design their own project shows that they have learned something during the school year,\u00a0and had a decent knowledge of what they had learned. Also a student-designed project will make the student not feel rushed. Having a student-designed project will make the student go at his or her pace. When a teacher makes a project for a class, theres most likely a rubric that the students must follow and a deadline of when the project must be turned in. Most students will feel rushed and will not put their maximum effort into doing the project on their own, and will probably try to cheat or copy of the internet. But having students design their own projects, they set their own rubric and follow their own deadline of when to get it done. When going at their own pace students will show their maximum effort into their project. Summer projects are required by some schools to assure that the students had learned something from the previous year and to continue their learning for the following year. It will tell the teacher what the student had learned and may need help on. Also it will also make the student not feel rushed when he or she was making the project. Giving a student the chance to design their own project will show self-advocacy\u00a0and how independent they are. Therefore, I believe that summer projects should be student-designed rather that teacher-designed",

    "Growing up most all of us have watched cartoons with self driving cars or movies with the idea of a car that can drive itself. But can you imagine if that idea could soon become real? Google and many other companys have been trying at this idea for years and have been very succseful with the expirement. The idea of a self driving car has snagged the attention of many people and especially Google who have acaully made this come true in 2009 when they made the first self driving car. These cars a have drove all over without a single acident reported. So as you can imagine this sparks the question, Are self driving car safer on the roads then normals car? Well self driving car all based on sensors that detect anything and everything in the road. They keep with the speed limit adamatically, stop at aproprited time and also slow down when is needed. Adomatic cars will reduce the amount of accidents we have on the road by a lot. Accident are moslty caused by a driver, with adomatic cars, they will stop quicker than a person has time to react. But this plan will only work if everyone gets a smart car. Say if three out of four people get a smart car there will still be some normal cars left on the road, which with those cars an aciddent can be made. Self driving cars can avoid all the natural accident such as an animal running in the road or bad weather conditons. In addition to that many driver become sleepy or distracted when it come to driving, when self driving car are machines that will not do that. With self drving cars there will be no need to get a license. Many teens struggle with passing the lenglthy test to get your license. As people age one of the most common things to get bad is eye sight This self driving cars elders can still do the things they need to do such as go to the store or visit family with have to relie on other people for tranportation. Self driving cars are going to be the safest option on the roads today They aviod accidents, reduce the cost of normal veichals and are more efficent than normals cars.

    "I am agreeing in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There is no need to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. That is because the House of Representatiives helps elect for us, it helps us to balance our votes and avoid problems of election. The Electoraal college helps the people out alot with the voting situation and helps us to better undrstand and know our new president. The broader significance of the electoral College is that the House of Representatives helps us vote for our new president. In source One paragraph three it says \"Your state's entitled alloment of electors equal the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each number in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators....\"That tells me that we the people are not alone in this process of voting who will be our next president. Also in the same source but paragraph five it states \"The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.\" This informs me that not only the House of Representavtives is involved in the elections.\u00a0 Tthe govenment is important to the Electoal College because the votes of the government count most to the College.\n It is evident that the Electoral College helps us to balance our votes. As stated in Source Three \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution...\" This lets me know that we -as the people- won't have to worry to much about the voting and selection of the president. Another peice of evidence stated in the same source and paragraph \"So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does...\" That states that not all people and states have to worry about who the president will be. The Electoral College hepls us out alot mostly to the big states in the United States. \nAbove all the Electoral College avoid problems of the elections. In source Three, paragraph Twenty-two it states \"The Electoral College avoids problems of the elections in whcich no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.\" This lets us know that the Electoral College is doing a good job on keeping the votes clean and simple to understand. Also stated in the same source and paragraph \"There is no pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a moajoity of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential electionn process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which ivariably producess a clear winner...\" That tells me that the Electoral College is keeping the votes on point.\n There are some people out there who don't agree with the Electoral College and dont like the way the votes are being put in because sometimes the president that they chose wasn't elected. They are wrong to disagree with the Electoral College because the College keeps everything going in order and in a clear path to let us know who our president will be. As stated in Source Two paragraph Ten \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in tur elect the president. This makes them disagree because they think that the Electoral College doesn't vote for their president, but they souldn't worry because they way they vote is by how many states helped the electors to vote for that presient being chosen as the president. Also In Source Two \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.\" That makes some people diagree also, but the Electoral College doesn't count how many people in each big or small state voted for president. All the college does is help the governmtent elect for the president that they most support and elect for. I agree that the Electoral College should be kept in favor because of all the help that it gives us and the government. Also the College helps us stay balanced on the votes so that nothing gets missplaced or missunderstood. Most of all it avoids problems during the election so that the people and the government are satisfied with their votes. The Eletroal College is a great way to keep things going at a clear election of the year. The Electoral College doesn't need any changes for me because even if they chose on the elections of the government the votes of the people still count to them as well. The votes of the peopel are important to the Electoral College just as much as the government's votes are.\u00a0 \u00a0",

The real fact is that the face on Mars is just a natural landform. \n When NSSA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft was in space it took pictures. A few days later NASA unveiled a image. There was a natural landform that looked like a human head, shadows gave the rock some eyes, a noes, and mouth. People began thinking that it was an acutal thing created by aliens. Scientists didn't believed this though. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. The team up there snapped picures of the landform again and people were eager to find out the truth about the face. After seeing the picture when it was appeared on a JPL web site people now knew the truth. It is just a landform and not a face created by aliens. It's obvious now, the face is just a naturtal landform. There were no aliens. ",
    "Driverless cars seem to be extremely close to releasing to the public. Many companies have been working on driverless cars for years. These cars have great potential to change the world of transportation. The cars have positive and negative aspects, but I believe that driverless cars will be a positive effect on the world. Driverless cars could change the transportation. It would make it easier to go place to place. Driverless cars could prevent accidents from occurring in everyday traffic. These cars would be much safer than a car with a reckless driver. Millions of car accidents happen every year, but driverless cars could potentially prevent most of these accidents. With a driverless car, the passengers are safer because the car is programmed to work well. If there was an emergency, someone could take the wheel and have control of the car. Driverless cars have great potential for public transportation. Driverless cars could act like a taxi or bus system. This system of driverless cars would safe people money by not owning their own car. It would be safer to have many of these cars. Millions are killed in drunk driving accidents, and these cars would give potential drunk drivers an alternative way to get home safely. These cars could be used in a public transportation system to help people travel in their every day lives. Driverless cars are approaching quickly, and there must be decisions made on their involvement of people's lives. These cars would be safer than reckless drivers on the road. These cars have a potiental of changing public transportation, and they would make it more convenient and safer for others. Although there are some negatives to driverless cars, the amount of positive aspects outweigh the negative aspects. Driverless cars should be developed and reach the public.",
    "Have you ever wondered why the citizens of a country have the opportunity to voice their opinion in which who they feel should be president. Well i found some information in source 1 that talks about electoral college. Electoral college is not a place but its a process that was found in the constitution as a compromise between election of president by the votes in congress and election oof the president by a popular votes of qualified citizens of the country. I think that they shouldn't change to popular vote in the United States because the electoral college is more fair and plus they don't know the outcome of the election of the popular votes of the prsident of the United States. I support the electoral college because it allows you to voice your opinions in which who you feel should been president. It's also makes you feel that once you voted that your opinion matters. In source 1 they talk about when the \"Presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday afterthe first Monday in November.\" also you help choose youir state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for yor candidate you are actually voting for you candidate's electors.\u00a0 In source 2 they explain it in more details. \"Under the electoral college system, voters votes not for thre president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" They mean that don't matter if you vote for \"John Kerry\" and he's a Democratic and the number of whoever pledge to Kerry would be added on to his votes. thats why i like the electoral college. But one the other hand, there saying that they might change it to the election of the popular votes of the president of the United States. I think they should keep using the electoral college because it actually have better benefits or outcomes because you know who you voted for and from what they told you you believe they can make it happen. There's some states that have a \"winner-take-all\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. But the bad side about the electoral college is that what happens if thr president you like is a republican but you like the democratic senator?

    "To allow cell phones in school is like letting kids play games and school is not fun and games One reason why cell phones should not be aloud in school is other schools might not allow cell phones so who are we going text or call and why would we just text a person that is only down the hall that we will be talking to in a few minutes at lunch. Another reason why cell phones should not be allowed in school is the halls and the lunch room would be really loud from all of the ring tones. That would be really annoying to the students in class. We come to school to learn and having cell phones around us is just distracting. Next thing you'll know students will start bringing ipods, portable gaming systems, and more. So, bringing cell phones to school doesn't help our education. It just distracts us because during class all you can think about is getting out of class to text your friend.

Even if the masses aren't satisfied, the Face will remain just a buttle or Martian mesa Martian mesas are common enough around Cydonia, the place where the Face was found. The Face only has shadows that make it appear like a face. Conspiracy theorists say that the Face might be evidence of ancient civilization on Mars, but defenders of NASA's budget beg to differ. As the text states \"There wasn't an alien monument after all.\"The passage also reads that Malin sent a team to capture a more clear picture of the Face. Some said that there might have been hidden alien markings, and they were proven wrong. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to get a clear picture of the Face. As it turns out, there really wasn't a alien monument after all. In the beginning, there was no face to begin with. The Face only had unusual shadows that made it look like a face. NASA unveiled the image for everyone to see and here in the passage it reads \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" This shows that there wasn't a face, just an illusion. There is the arguement that the Face is evidence of an ancient civilization At the time the picture of the Face was taken, it was winter. Perhaps the alien markings were hidden by the cloudy haze. Mission controllers even looked again On a cloudless, summer day, the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take the another picture, in hope there was something that they didn't see. Even so, the scientists were proven right again. The Face was really a mesa, a landform common in Cydonia. In conclusion, the Face turned out to be a common landform. Just another buttle, another landform, another rock formation, not really a face at all. There is no evidence that there was even a civilization and there wasn't even evidence that there was life to begin with! Again, there could have been alien markings that were covered by the haze, and there could have been life on Mars. Let us face the facts though; in this reality; there isn't a face on Mars, there isn't a civilization on Mars and it is just another landform. ",
    "The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished. the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer's article, \"Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy\" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled \"swing states\". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion...\" (21) While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced. In retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished. It is an inherently unfair system and it does not reflect the views of American voters ",
    "I agree with this statement this can help students social skills This helps their social skills because when they are doing new things like playing a sport,doing student council,and working on yearbooks all of those things include team work. Students will have to work with their peers while on a sports team when they are competing or even at practice, because they have to communicate what their next move is going to be. When your in a team working on yearbooks you and your team have to work together to come up with designs,headlines,and even captions. This takes a lot of social skills because you have to agree on ideas, and to help each other\u00a0to create a final product. Even while doing student council for a extracurricular activity takes a lot of social skills, because you have to work together to create fun and amazing actives for the students at your schools. You also have to communicate with the students in your school to see what ideas they have for actives they would like to see and come to in the future. Having friends is a big part in life so your not lonely, so these activities can help you with making new friends When your playing a sport or even watching a sport on TV you can tell that they are like a family. So when your playing a sport maybe you are playing with people you haven't meet before, thats a great opportunities\u00a0to talk and see what you guys have in common. Yearbook is a very good way to make friends because you are in groups working and planning together, and that helps you get to know them more by talking and hearing there ideas. Also by interviewing people and taking pictures of the people in your school can help you meet new people that you havent meet before. Student council is a great opportunity\u00a0to make friends because you are working with people everyday to make school a fun place to be. Even hosting event can be a great place to mingle with new and even older kids in you school. helps the kids to be more outgoing I am a very shy person so I know how it feels when you go somewhere new and you dont know anybody. These things can helps students break out of their shell and talk to new people. Also this helps students be more outgoing to a teacher as well because that helps student feel safe, and helps then feel ensured that they have a trusted adult. Having a trusted adult is a good thing for kids when they are going through hard times, because they are to scared and shy to trust someone they just meet, and to tell their issues to. Being outgoing is a good trait in life so you can make friends and be able to do new thing, and not be scared about doing it. Which is why it's good to be outgoing earlier in life, so when you get older it's easier to get a job. I'd say be outgoing is a very good thing to be good at and being able to stay after with new people and talk with them can have an impact on that. Extracurricular actives can help you get away from negative things in your life that you might go home to,or face in a school day. These actives can keep you away from those thing because\u00a0then this is your time to stay at school for a longer and do something you enjoy. These actives can help you get you mind off of thing happening in your life and bad things that happen at school and maybe help you feel less overwhelmed. Not having to go home straight away to do all the homework, and you get to hangout with friends and relax from school work. Program like these have shown that these things help kids do better in school because they have something they enjoy in their day and not be pressured to get good grades and to spend hours on homework everyday to get perfect scores on their test. Students need time to have a time to them self to release\u00a0stress and have a good time with their friends. Having these actives for kids help them stay active while they are participating in a sport and even when they are participating in other actives the school offers. These thing help kids get out of their house and stops them from watching TV, and playing video games all the time. Yearbook could be a better solution because even though your looking at a computer it still helps your brain going and helps your brain thinking. Programs that allow kids to do extra actives allows the students to be more healthier because they are either moving and exercising their body or their brain. I think a reason that schools have these actives is so students are sitting a home and for students to be more involved at school. Also another thing that these thing helps students health is because they aren't always stressed all the time to heavy classes with lots of homework. These students are doing fun and easy classes to help them be more active and involved at their school.",
    "I believe that changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a bad decision. If the school policy was changed there would not be many students participating in sports or other activities. Many students have a grade C average which would inconvenient them from participating in school sports and/or activities.\nNot many students who have a grade B average are athletic to participate in sports but would enjoy participating in school activities such as clubs. But if there are not enough students to participate in school sports it would just be a waste of money to purchase equipment for those sports. Many students who play sports have a grade C average and are very athletic students. It would also be unfortunate for students who do play sports to not be able to participate if they have a grade C average. If those students do not participate they would probably not participate in school activities that they do not enjoy.\n Changing school policy is also a bad idea because many students rely on athletic scholarships to get into college since not all families are lucky enough to send their children to college without having to worry about have financial problems doing so But since the prices for college tuition is going up not many students have enough money to attend college right after high school. Many of those students also have a grade C average. Also many students who are very good at sports but not very academically skilled may see that sports are what help them get by in life. Those students also find it very difficult to get into a good college they can afford if they have a grade C average but do not have a chance to get into a college if they cannot get a scholarship for athleticism.\n So I hope you reconsider of changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average because not many students do. Those students may also rely on baseball or football scholarships to get into college if they cannot afford it on their own. Also they schools would be wasting money for buying sports equipment if there are not enough students for those sports to play since many of them have a grade C average.",

    "Yes, many people do think that the \"Face on Mars\" was a monument created by aliens, possibly creating a sign of some sort. However, this is not true. What you think is the \"face\" is actually a natural landform. This natural landform may appear to look like a face, but why?\n The landform looks like a face becuase of the shadows that hit the landform in certain areas. \"... this... had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh (2).\" It makes it look somewhat like a face. \"...a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth (3).\" Another reason why the landform looks like a face is becuase our eyes, that play tricks on us, may make it seem real that it is a face. Such as illusion that make it appear that the landform looks like a face that is staring up at the camera on Mars. Many poeple, however will still ask for more evidence that the landform is not alien artifact. \"...Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origional... photos... when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no monument at all (7).\" \"What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West... That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars (12).\" So the landforms that you are seeing are actually common along the American West. They don't just pop up out of nowhere. They have been seen before. It's not like it is a first thing that scientists are just discovering. This evidence proves that there is no alien monument on Mars, it may appear to look like it. But scientists have proved that it is only a natural landform, created naturally, on Mars. Not an alien monument that was created as a sign by aliens on Mars.",
    "Over the years cell phones have become a very useful tool .The demand of using a phone has risen in today's society . But should we be able to use our cell phones while being on the road? The number of people that have used their phones on the roads and highways have increased so much . Some people don't understand how important it is to be completely focused on the road and for the people in their car and everyone near them. Should we leave a message unread or not answer a call or answer the text or call but be at risk of causing the life of someone ? People tend to always want to be on their phones and be in touch with other people during social media, call, or text , despite the danger of causing an accident. We keep our phones closer than our loved ones. Phones are a constant distraction such as meetings, movies ,meals and especially when we are driving. Everyday people die from car accidents because someone was using their phone while driving . Studies have shown that there is a 4% greater risk of drivers being in a car accident due to using a cell phone. Overall the crashes every year because of cell phones are 1.6 millions with 330,000 million injured in them. Hands free devices can also be harmful You are focused on the road but if something happens to your phone for example the call ended or you received a message then you are distracted and want to grab your phone . A lot of people would think that probably if I just take one second to look at my phone nothing will happen. But that's not true a car accident can happen based on the driver not looking on the road . You can't multitask when you are driving ! If you would like to be a safe driver you would have to make sure you process a ton of information about your environment and surroundings at all times. Georgia's new hands free cell phone law has resulted in more than 1,000 tickets since the start of the law Georgia's residents aren't allowed to have their phone in their hand or part of their body . They are only allowed to use if it's on a wireless headphones, speaker or bluetooth . Their first fine is $50 , second is $100, and third is $150 and a subsequent conviction . Georgia has become the 16th state that enacted a hands free driving law. Georgia would like for residents to stop using their devices when driving because cell phones only continue to increase the number of accidents. It's a privilege to be able to drive and we shouldn't just think about ourselves but about the people we are risking when we are driving. Cell phones are a very important tool in our life but we should know when it's not the right time to use it. It's better to leave the phone down and ignore the missed calls and texts then not being able to get to our destination and being with our loved ones because we couldn't leave our phone down. Put it down and just drive ! ",
    "Have you ever thought on keeping the Electoral Vote or change it by popular vote for the president of the United States? I think you have. Well, we know what Electoral Vote is, the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens On my opinion the Electoral Vote should be changed in order for people to vote for the president they want. \n To begin with, the Electoral vote has a job to do. For example,if someone wants to run for president and the electoral vote has no voice in the selection there is a probability that the person doesn't get a change to talk to the people. As stated on\n(Source 3)\n\"..... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.\" This means that we the people have no right on electing the president. Every vote for a president it first goes through the Electoral Vote hands and then they decide whether or not to set him as a president. Moreover, the Electoral Vote is like the king of a country, it decides the president and its votes. In the Constitution there is an amendment that says evryone is equal . however in this except from\n(Source 3)\nsays otherwise, \" So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaing than small states does...\" The founding father were part of the Constitution but also part of the Electoral Vote, which have been taken that amendment way too far. In conclusion, the Electoral Vote is been taking evrything to their power. They should be removed from electing presidents. They are going to be ",
    "The Face on Mars is a very talked about landform on Mars and it brings many conspiract theories with it. NASA stresses that it is a natural landform called a mesa while other beleive it was made by aliens. NASA says it is a natural landform becuase it is in the Cydonia region of Mars which has many landform like the Face They have also done extensive research on the Face and took many photos over the years. Their latest photo was in 2001. This photo was evidence that it had to be natural because each pixel shoed only 1.56 meters which meant that if there was any strage markings or buildings they would easily be seen. NASA also states the the Face on Mars is very similar to mesas on earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, says \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...\".\n With the research NASA has done and with all the photo evidence it is easy to say that the Face on Mars is indeed a natural landform. Everything NASA has done to prove this eliminates any speculation or doubt brought up by the public. The Face on Mars is just another reason to appreciate the beauty of the universe and the hard work of NASA. ",
    "The author finds that studing Venus would be a good thing because of how it is or was similar to earth There is evidence of Venus being largely being covered by oceans as weel as mountains and valleys with rocky sediments this may give clues or refrences about extraterestrial life that humans have been looking for. Even though exploration on the surface of venus may be near impossible for humans, machines may be able to explore a given time on the suface of Venus colecting samples from things like rocks.\n Venus has analougous features that are similar to Earth and this may lead to certain discoverys about the potential of life that may have survived on Venus Since Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth it makes reaching Venus easy but that dosent mean it is like our planet becuse of the atmosphere letting all of the heat inside. If we are able to explore Venus then it may give us confidence to expore other planets that may be like Venus. Finding other lifeforms of materials other than what is already on earth may be huge to humans and give us a boost in what we know as well as have. This is why exploring Venus may be benificial to scientists to make any discoverys that will help the human race and possibly find another planet that sustains life or another planet to live on. Finding clues on Venus about the past may prove as a good thing as well possiblly telling us if planets go through phases where they can sustain life and when they can't. There may possibly be remains of a civilization on the other planets that we do not know about. ",
    "The invention of driverless cars is a really good idea. The driverless cars have many developments and improvements. Driverless cars can alert drivers to when something bad is about to happen. The cars are eco friendly because they use half the fuel that taxis use today. With all of the improvements it has, these cars will be one of the safest cars on the road. With all of the improvements on the driverless car the car will be safer. They have invented a track that sends signals to a reciever on the front end of the car. The reason for this is the senors to alert the driver. The senors tell the driver what is all around them. They have developed senors to help alert the driver whne something bad is about to happen. The senors have become more advanced, and are able to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. The information from the senors can make the car apply the brakes on the individual wheels and reduce the engine's power. The most important piece of technology is the Dubbed LIDAR. It uses laser beams to scan 3-D images of the car constantly. This allows the car to have a better response and control than a human driver alone. General motors has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. With all of the new technolgy being developed, these driverless cars will be safer.\n The driverless cars will be a safer car. These cars have been driven more than half a million miles without a crash. The makers of these cars believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. The reason for this is the senors to alert the driver. The senors tell the driver what is all around them. Another reason these are good cars, is that they use less fuel than the average car, and it will have more flexibility than a bus. Overall the driverless car is a safer car. It will have the new technology that the other cars do not have. The senors will help alert the driver when there is something behind them or to the side of them. The senors help make this car a safer car for all people. People all around would want this car because it is safe for children and other people. They should develope this car because it si safe for the environment and for other drivers. ",
    "I think for the election for presidency its should be counted on the popular vote. Why I think it should be on the popular vote is because it should count on what the people vote on,not on the electoral college. We should be the people to have the vote on the president and not just a piece of it. Plus the electoral colleges don't even vote on the president,they vote on a slate for the electors who then vote for president.\nvoting should be on the popular vote now because the electoral colleges are not even voting on the president they're voting on the electors who vote for president. When if there was a direct vote we would then be voting just for the president. Yes sometimes we would vote someone else for president by accident , but not as much as the electoral college does. thats why I think we should have a direct vote instead of having the electoral colleges voting for us pretty much. It just sounds like it would woork better if the people voted for president and not the people voinng for elctors who then vote for the president. ",
    "I think that every student should do community service you do this to help the community not to satisfy your self. Community service is to help people in need that is the real meaning of community service. Also community service is about doing thing with out receiving and not getting anything back because you do it only to help. Also another reason of why the principle should make his students do community service is because if they do not do it they will never do any thing for poor or other people, or if they do service hours they won't do it to help they will just do them because their parents told them. Also the principle should help them see how hard is for other people to live so they will relice that they are lucky have parent or to go to school because there are people who do not have anything. That is why I think the principle should make his students do service hours, so that they can help others. ",
    "It has come to my attention as a student, that you may be changing your policies on cell phone use in school. It is my personal opinion that you should allow student to use their phones outside of class I think this because, myself being a student here, cell phones allow students to contact their families, contact teaching staff stay in touch with one another during school hours. First off, we students are often given difficult projects that we must complete. For example, a group project assigned to two students who don't see each other outside of school hours Wouldn't it be better for these to students to be able to speak to one another during school hours? Secondly, students may need to contact their families during the day A student may be a bus rider, but due to bad weather the student may need to be picked up by car. It would be much easier for this student to be able to use their cell phone then to have to borrow one from a teacher or go to the office. Or they may need to tell their mother or father to turn the stove off or let the dog out. lastly, a student may need to contact a member of the teaching staff for information on a project. Or they may need to ask a question about tonight's homework. Or maybe another student falls and injures themselves, or a fight brakes lose, it would be easy and very convenient to be able to use cell phones in school. To conclude, the use of cell phones during school would be very beneficial for the student population. I hope I have made you see clearer the benefits of allowing us students to use them.",
    "Have you ever wondered about the Face on Mars? You probably told yourself it wasn't real, or you're one of those people who have done their research and love the idea of it being real Well, I'm here today to tell you how it's not created by aliens. Aliens don't exist to our knowledge yet, so therefore we cannot assume that it was made by them.\n First, as we refer back to the 2001 picture, it looks cracked and it looks like it was covered In the 1998 picture, it looked like it was somewhat burning. In the 1976 Viking 1 picture towards the middle of the article, it shows the shadows, making it look like a human face. The eye was caused because of a hole, so it was dark. The nose was caused by the shadow on the right half of the face. Then, NASA knew it was going to get popular very fast, and it did. It was a pop icon all over the world. For example, \"It had starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" (5). That goes to show NASA was in it for more fame, because who doesn't want to see a face on Mars? Finally, it's just a natural landform! As the article states, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image appeared first on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform\" (7). You shouldn't always believe what you hear. It wasn't (an) alien(s) who made it. It was a natural landform with a few shadows on it, that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. The Face on Mars wasn't made by aliens. The pictures show it. NASA also just wanted to get popular off of it, because they know how us people are. We'd die to believe anything is true. It's also just a natural landform. ",
    "Many kids all over the country talk on cell phones. We use them to communicate with one another. We also use cell phones for emergencies. For example if are out with your friends and you need to talk with one of your parents what do u do? You call them or text them. All though you can use them for urgent cares students at school and adults at work can get distracted bye a cell phone. Policy one states, students are allowed to bring cell phones to school and only use them during lunch and passing period but phones have to be turned off during class time. Policy two states, students are not allowed to have cell phones at all Policy two is a better choice because have a cell phone can be extremely distracting to students and maybe even teachers. School is a department of education to learn new things and life long skills. Students also might get hurt texting on a phone they will be to busy to pay attention to a flight of stairs two steps away. If you decide policy one you might have complaints about cell phones ringing during the middle of class which does not just alarm the owner but also the rest of the class. By picking policy two you have eliminated the disruption for students and have made it easer for students to learn as much as possible.",

While describing why scientists consider visits to venus, the author states \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in out solar system...The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable\"(4).\nBy presenting that scientists want to visit Venus then almost immediately jumping to the weak conclusion that the \"value of returning to Venus seems indisputable\", the author fails to explain why the scientists want to visit Venus and why those reasons are important or significant.\nWithout an explanation of facts, writers leave the reader to create conclusions in their own minds, possibly without a complete understanding, weakening the authors support of his or her own claim or idea. Second, the author doesn't support the idea effectively because he or she creates the picture in the reader's mind that successful and worthwhile travel to Venus is nearly impossible and certainly not attainable with today's technology. While writing on what would be necessary for travel and observation of Venus, the author states \"a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions...[and be] survivable for humans.\nHowever, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions...[Also,] standard forms of photography...[would be] innefective...Therefore, sciendtists seeking to...understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks\"(5).\nBy stating that \"a vehicle hovering over Venus\" would be safe for humans and then directly stating that it would not be enough and that scientists who want useful information would have to \"get up close and personal despite the risks\", the author states conflicting ideas.\nIn addition, earlier in the passage the author states \"On the planet's surgace, temperatures average over 800 degrees\"(3).\nThis creates another serious flaw in the author's idea, because the conditions stated are not even close to survivable. Combining the evidence presented by the author would point to the conclusion that astronomers would need to be using vehicles and photography equipment that currently don't exist and, even with unavailable technology, they must be willing to die to travel to Venus for study.\nThis creates the idea in the reader's head that studying Venus is impossible, which greatly weakens the author's claim.\nAll in all, impossibilities, conflicting ideas, and a lack of explanation of evidence crontribute to a weak argument in favor of the idea that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

    "Distance learning is a good thing it allows kids who can't come to school a chance to get education. This could also become a casual tool that allows kids who missed school to get and stay caught up with their classes People all over the world could benefit from this new form of technology.\n Sometimes as a person with high anxiety, I dont like school because of all the loud and compacted areas. distance learning this allows me to be able to focus somewhere and feel safe This also goes with anything else as well, you dont have to have anything wrong with you to use it. Maybe you wake up one day and realize today isn't a good day, not an issue call in do what you gotta do and attend class online. People who attend school regularly can benefit too Say you miss a day or two of school due to the flu, with distance learning you can be there still while at home taking notes and keeping yourself rested. This could be integrated in many other ways as well, maybe the teacher is out one day or not everyone could go on the field trip. This technology opens a whole new door to the learning world\u00a0and allows kids to expand and strengthen their education. Kids who cant come to school should all be offered a chance, everyone should have an education and with this new technology you can Third world countries where there's people who have never gotten education will now have that option available. Kids who cant control their lives in those particular places shouldn't be shut off from society. With this we will be able to teach and give knowledge to other people to hopefully make something more beneficial. Distance learning benefits everyone because it makes education more accessible\u00a0and helpful to all. With this new innovative technology people will be able to build past knowledge and even gain new. people all over the world will be impacted by this technology even if you don't directly use it.\u00a0",
    "The use of this technology to read students emotional expressions, is pointless. I say this because a persons emotions could switch very quickly. Also, this technology has been tested on paintings, paintings dont have emotions. This means that the technology is wrong. If a website or app is detecting emotions from picture what makes you think it could detect emotions from a real peson. This \"new\" technology doesn't make any scense. Why would someone possibly let a machine tell them how there feeling. Theres no way possible that a painting has emotions, it may look sad or happy but it has no true emotions. There are many different apps that do different things. Theres even a app that detects lies. These apps are fake. No cellphone app could really tell you if your lying or not. This technology should be tested out on many humans. Just to be sure.\n Different people have different opinions, but only scientist will actually know the truth. Even scientist can be proven wrong so its more of a the world may never know type of situation. Until actual proof of this technology is being shown i personally will not believe it. ",

Well, what's it going to be? Keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular votes for the president of the United States? In the text In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the presiden it states that, \"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popualr votes the winner.\" This means that The Electoral College is like a person or a thing that seems to belong to the past and it doesnt fit into the president It aslo states that the advocates of the position are correct for agruing that the Electoral College is not a modern sense, it's the electors who elect the president, not the people. In the text The indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong states that \" It's official: The electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.\" This means that people now know the truth, they think that it is unfair and will not listen to your opinion or anything you have to say about the president or senators you elect.

    "The author studys Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers becuse there are many things out there that could be discoverd worth thr dangers.

    "Aliens are real, Frank I'm telling you. The aliens made that face on Mars. Why do you think that, Grayson? No one can step on Mars. If a person steps on Mars, they will die. No one has ever been to Mars, Still to this day. Are you sure about what you are saying? I'm sure about this. Aliens live in the galaxy. They can step on any planet whenever they want to and not die. Well I have something to say. Aliens do not exist. If they were real, they would have took over the world. They would have been making us do work every single day. f they came here they would probaly have killed us by now. Have they killed us, have they started making us do work? No, they haven't. Grayson? Yes, Sir? I heard you and Kevin talking about how aliens made that face on mars. Both of you are wrong. You were right about the no aliens part, but everything else was wrong. We just now figured out that it was just another Martian mesa. It is common enough in Cydonia. When we took the picture, I have got a lot of e-mails saying \"what is that thing?\" I even got a e-mail from Michael Bay saying that he is going to use that image for a movie. This stuff is crazy! The picture is accually the Martian of a butte or mesa. It's common across the American west. I hope we can find more stuff like that. Me too that was a wierd experience. ",
    "I believe that students should perform community service. Students like me have it to easy. Now don't get me wrong students do work hard, However not hard enough Lets take my friend for example he does no work at home or at school, Yet he still has a playstation three. He lives in Atlantic City New Jersey. He tells me that there is plastic and all sorts of litter on the ground and there is no one there to pick it up. Right here in Central Islip there is litter on the ground and I see no one pick it up. I am upset to see this. I want people to come in Central Islip and say what a clean city with educated kids. Not what a dirty city with stupid kids. In conclusion, I believe that if you make community service mandatory Central Islip will be the cleanest city in at least five years.",
    "Have you ever been stuck in a difficult\u00a0situation, and it seems like you'll never get out? Next time when your in something like that try consulting multiple people over just one. You would do this because getting multiple peoples opinions can help prevent the out come from being bias help you get a better perspective of whats actually happening in someones else point of view. If it's politics or a certain friend. Point is everyone has something that they care a lot about, but sometimes that something they care a lot\u00a0about can become bias to a situation. If your ever in a tough spot or in an argument get multiple peoples thoughts on the situation so you know its not bias. It will help better the out come, and it may also help you make the right choice. If you get multiple perspectives you can see the situation from different spots to help you better understand it. Also it will help you get more knowledge on the subject. Then you can understand what is going on all around not just in your head. This will help by making it more understandable When asking for advise talk to multiple people so that you; Avoid bias opinions, and you can get multiple perspectives on the situation. These things will help better your opinions,\u00a0and help you make the right choice.\u00a0",
    "Asking for advice from different people can help people make better choices. Asking multiple people for advice can give someone a better solution to their problem that they might not have thought to use or\u00a0help them make a correct decision between two choices. Even if a person is faced with an easy decision like choosing an outfit, sometimes they might just want a little help deciding. It is always good to make the best decision possible and asking multiple people can help people make decisions. Asking for advice from multiple people can give people different ways to resolve their problems A shy person may have a different view than a super chatty person. For example, my friend skipped four questions in an english assignment; she hit submit on her computer and got four questions wrong because she did not see them. She could not talk to the teacher because she had a substitute that day. She asked two friends, one was a little shy and the other one was super chatty. The shy friend said to email her teacher telling her what my friend accidently did, the other friend said that she should wait until the teacher was back and talk to her in person. She did not think of emailing her teacher and explaining what happened. It is more likely she would have waited until her teacher was back and then not gotten full credit on her assignment. Talking to multiple people gave her a solution that she would not have thought to use and worked better better than her original idea. \n Sometimes people need advice choosing between two solutions for their problems. If someone can't decide which is the better solution for their problem, asking multiple people can help. An example of this would be when\u00a0I got invited to two birthday parties on the same day that were almost the same time. One birthday party was for my friend who I had not seen in a little over a month, while while the other birthday party was for my cousin who I saw quite often, but I would feel bad missing his party. I asked three friends whether I should go to my cousin's or my friend's birthday party. Two of my friends said to go to my friend's birthday party and one of my friends said to go to my cousin's birthday party. I decided to go to my friend's birthday party because I hadn't seen her in a while and I missed her. I also decided I would take my cousin out to dinner to celebrate his birthday. I am very glad that I talked to my friends because they helped me make the best choice that was possible. In conclusion, asking for advice from multiple people can help a person make the best choice possible. Whether it is an easy or a hard decision everyone needs advice at somepoint and asking more than one person can help decision making. If someone needs help deciding between two things, or thinking of a solution to their problem, asking multiple people can make their decision a little easier. With all the decisions people make in life, making every decision as easy as possible is the best thing people can do.\u00a0\u00a0 ",
    "Heres something you might be interested in doing activities outside that you may have never wanted to do before. yes you should do extracurriculars you could get out of the house more, do something that your really passoinate about and could maybe do that for a living when your older, you could try new things and expiernce things you havent expierenced before. \n You dont always have to be excersizing to be outside or doing something other than being in your house all day. When you get out of the house you think about things like walking the dof through the neighborhood, or dropping your kids off with thier friends somewhere but you never really think about other things you could be doing when your not busy. You could hands down take a long walk around the neighborhood matter fact you could even jog/run,You could pick up some trash around the neighborhood and watch the ecosystem and get out more. \n So what im saying is if you find the right thing for you your out of the ball park. You have a chance to get away from the world and do what you love doing when your not doing school work or other things like that. You have a chance t be yourself without people judging everything little thing that goes on in your life. Plus if your really goos at it you could do your passion for a living whe your older like you could get a job that has something to do with something your really interested in and getting paid a little better than you would doing something thats not fun at all. You could try things that you usually wouldnt try when you are staying at home playignvideo games and watching netflix in your room. And maybe if you try the right thing you will really get into it and keep getting better at whatever your interested in. Sometimes your sitting at home bored because you dont spend enough time doing other things like for exam[ple you could go out side and do a couple laps around your house to get a little bit more energy out. All I can tell you is when you find something your interested in you will know it because your gonna want to do it 24/7. I hope that you really take into consideration doing some extracurriculars. You would really like doing something your interested in instead of just sitting around at home ding absolutely nothing. Some people just take awhile to find what their interested in but when they find it they stick with it until the day they can't anymore. ",
    "Attending school practically takes up our entire day, and our entire lives. By the time we get up, get ready, travel to school, attend class, then come home to do additional homework, or entire day is gone. Additionally, we also spend five of the seven days of the week attending class, and those other two days of the weekend are overwhelmed with more homework. What about those who live far away? If they were at home, they would actually be able to get more work done as their commute time is absent. Where is their time allotted to spend time with family when your whole life is centered around school? Lastly, what about those who have a mental illness, that disables them to attend school for a whole day? Students would benefit to a great extent if they could take classes online it would cut out commute time, allowing them to work more would permit more time to do other activities like spending time with family, would also benefit those who have chronic mental illnesses as these individuals struggle to spend eight hours a day physically at school. For those who live a great distance away from a school, online classes would benefit them to a great extent. The commute time takes up hours of there day, especially if they ride the bus. School is only eight hours a day, but including travel time, the act of going to school can take up ten or more hours of an individual's 24 hour time period. This permits them from being able to get all there homework done, and can also make them more tired since they must get up early to travel, and then stay up late since they get home much later. This results in an unfocused student, who hardly pays attention in class and additionally, a student who doesn't get as much work done. With online classes, the travel time is absent. This allows a student to learn and work more. The student would have more time in the day to spend quality time working. This would result in a more focused, determined individual. When your entire day is centered around school- the traveling, class, and homework- students have little time to participate in activities they enjoy and spend time with family, which is crucial for mental stability. Teachers preach of having good grades, extracurriculars, and family time, but school is eliminating these options for the majority of students With online courses, students can take their time working on school, but would also have time to spend with family and do extracurriculars. This would result in a balanced lifestyle; a lifestyle that isn't overwhelmed with work. The balanced lifestyle would reflect in the student's learning ability, as they would now be more calm and focused to do their work. For those who have a disabling mental illness, online classes would benefit them greatly. When a student has depression, anxiety etc., they often find themselves unable to attend school for a full day, or even at all. Likewise, if they are present, they cannot focus and by the end of the school day, they are so mentally and physically exhausted that they cannot get their homework done. Their grades suffer as a result. With distance learning, they can work at their own pace, taking the necessary breaks when needed. The individuals would not be concerned with falling behind, because they would be able to do the work when they were mentally stable. Mental illnesses are just as serious as physical illnesses, and the act of physically going to school can be detrimental to their health, and to their grades. Online schooling would allow them to achieve a stable well-being, and a higher state of learning. The act of physically going to school does not benefit everyone, therefore, online learning would be a beneficial option. Distance learning would still allow for those to achieve an education, but in a more peaceful environment. It would allow students to spend more time on their work since travel time is cut out, and would also permit those to have a balanced life as they spend time doing extracurriculars, being social, and spending time with family. It would greatly impact those with mental illnesses, as it would allow them to work when they are in a healthy mental state, and allow them to work at anytime. This would result in a higher level of knowledge, a more stable mental health, and better grades Some may argue that school is necessary for social interactions. This argument can be rebutted, as those who choose online courses would actually have more time to be social ",
    "How do you get to where you need to go? Do you take a bus, drive a vehicle, ride a bicycle or walk? In 2005 in the United States, almost everybody had a personal vehicle for transportation needs. People all around the world are working to break the habbit of using a motorized vehicle to get places. Scientists say that driving the vehicle has a very bad effect on the enviroment. In Vauban, Germany people are suburban pioneers. They have forbidded street parking, driveways and home garages. Their streets are car free, with some few exceptions. They have allowed car ownership, but there are only two places to park. They have large garages at the edge of the development, where the car owner has to buy a space that costs $40,000, along with a home. As a result of these limitations, 70% of people do not own cars, and 57% sold their car to move here. Heidrun Walter, a mother of two says that \"When I had a car I was always tense. I`m much happier this way.\" Vauban is a growing trend in Europe, that was completed in 2006. Experts say that it is a huge effort to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\nIn Paris, they have enforced a partian driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday`s motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their vehicle at home or suffer a $31 fine. On Tuesdays, the odd numbered license plates would follow the same regulations. Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after the intensifying smog. Smog is a big problem in France, and it even rivaled China`s most polluted cities in the world. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals.\nIn Bogota, Colombia there was a program that is set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaze says that \"It`s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" Authorities from other countries came to witness this event and were enthusiastic and believes they are generating a revolutionairy change and it is crossing borders. Parks and sport centers have bloomed throughout the city. Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks and the rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.\nIn America, President Obama has ambitious goals to curb the greenhouse gas emissions and has gained a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior. America had long been one of the world`s prime car cultures, where it was the birthplace of the Model T. It seems that America`s love affair for its vehicles is cooling. The miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and has been on a steady decrease since then. Sociologists believe that if this pattern continues it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the eviroment since transportation is the second largest source of America`s emissions, right behind the power plants. Many people are taking advantage of car pooling apps, the internet is helping keep people connected so that they don`t have to drive somewhere just to talk to someone. There has been a large drop in percentage of 16 years olds to 39 year olds getting a license. A study last year found that driving by young people has decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009. Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company has laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industy to create cities in which pedestrian, bicylce, private cars, commercial and public transportaion are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve power, lower emissions and improve safety. Do you think you will still take a motorized vehicle to get to wherever you are going after reading this article? If not, you could be one of the many people that would contribute to saving the Earth and it`s precious enviroments We are going through a revolution of enviromental friendly transportation, are you going to be apart of this?

    "Student's will benefit from take the school classes at home instead of going to the school because they could work at their own pace Student's dont have to wake up early in the mornings and be tried and if Student's come to school all tried they wont do the work most of the time. If the Student's take online classes then can finish\u00a0anytime without have to worried about the class finishing and not hand in an incomplete\u00a0assignment This way if student's are really sick and can't come to school and are going to be out of school for weeks then this will help the student's keep on track with the class. If the schools did the online classes they wont have to be worried about snow days A other benefit is being at home everyday and not have to move around a lot Students would focus more because they have no one to talk to during the online classes. A other reasons this is good is that student's that dont come to school a lot\u00a0can stay at home while they can do the school work at home instead of go to school and not showing up. Student's would probably\u00a0have better grades because they would be finishing the work. It would be easy the get help if the student's dont understand they can just search it up on the internet or ask someone in their house for some help. The student's can take brakes during this time so they dont tried of doing a lot of work. This can also help the student's with computer skill while doing online school. Student's would get better information\u00a0while doing this and it will come a long way in the future for them. A other good reason is that the student's can show their mom or dad they did their work so they can do what ever they went after because most of time student's dont show their mom or dad that they have been doing work in school. This would make somethings easier for people like the people who dont like to come to school or the people who dont like to wake up early in the morning. It will save a lot of time for the student's and teacher's\u00a0because they wouldn't have to be there the whole day at school. It will make more people like school because you can take it online and you can finsh it at any hour but its due that day.\u00a0",
    "The concept of online schooling is very simple work at home ask questions later It is something we agree with because it is really only beneficial to those who dont have the resources or tools anyway. It presents itself with being very universal and outgoing and comfortable because who wouldnt wanna learn new things in the comfort of their own home However, It is a factor that revolves around endless distractions little too none human interaction and very little visual an guided learning. Being a teen parent doing online courses sounds so day filling and convenient but being a regular student very average with distractions and new task every where you go For students distraction is always near and it is hard too not get distracted. Lets say your family just flew in its a week before the holiday an you want too do what they are doing like go to the movies or wrestle or play on your new Xbox. School work or online courses would not be on your mind which would cause more people to fall behind in there courses. Distractions are a factor in anything presented too you For example, your teacher hands u a piece of paper and says write your name while they are talking you might lean over and talk too the person next too you about the paper or get on your phone and miss the instructions that were given. Human interaction is some what needed to preform any task although, If you are anything like me then you like too be shown how too do everything given and you will need an explanation after every thing that they are showing you Human interaction is the quickest reply you will ever get and man to man and skin too skin contact is a way too keep from becoming antisocial . Working at home might cause you too feel like you dont need anyone too help you an you might just wanna be alone all the time . Most of the time people will develop early on issues because they feel that the help they needed was not provided during this stage or process. I know some of you are probably thinking that they have parents why cant they just help them however, not everyone is provided with that option what if there parents did not graduate or what if they did not further their education. This why public schooling or private schooling should be put into action and thought about Online courses are not specified too those that need visuals and need too visualize before completing an action. Visual learning also goes with human interaction it is something that helps us succeed in the real world. In the real world in order too ask questions or in order to get a job you have too complete a face too face interview. The world is starting too become more and more lenient on the concept and the uses of technology. But, No one is going too hire someone with un-professional attire too become there lawyer its not really acceptable in the place of business due too the views ,perceptions and, standards of the world. The way you dress or look in your home is different then when you leave your home they will not learn these real world skills because they werent taught and didnt develop those characteristics like everyone else. In conclusion, Online schooling or online courses are only truly beneficial too those that need it and those that are doing it due to circumstance and it should not be encouraged amoungst those that do not have a great amount of self control and self reliance. Without those skills and without interpersonal skills they will not succeed and they will not learn daily life skills. it seems very simple but it is not and should not be treated as such",
    "Have you heard the saying two heads are better than one Because, having more opinions are better when making tough choices. Having multiple opinions might lead you to a more realistic choice like deciding how to spend your money, the popular choice like deciding what color to paint the wall, even the correct choice like on a test For example, last week I asked a friend for his opinion on a question and got it right. Because, I had asked his opinion and, he pointed out the hidden \"not,\" I got the answer correct. Like if, you're planing to get a dog and, your friend shows you that it costs a lot to care for dogs so you don't end up buying it. Or maybe, you want to learn a foreign language and, your friend reminds you you can't spell anything, so you don't doing it. Or if you're like me, and you shoot for straight A's but, you miss a lot of school days, so your friend just tells you to try to just get mostly A's and some B's so that you still have a good grade. Because he gave me his opinion, I didn't stress my self over trying to get a higher grade. if you are split between two types of flooring, you can ask for someone's opinion so that way you can decide. Or if, your deciding what to bring to the party just ask for everyone's opinion on what to bring. Okay, I've brought some cookies to a party before and someone was allergic, so let's just say you should probably get someone's opinion on the matter before you bring something to a party. Because, that child may or may not have been hospitalized cause of the cookies. if you got lost driving somewhere and, you can ask one of the locals opinion's on where to go. Maybe you're on a game show, and you ask the audience\u00a0for their opinion on what to chose and it ends up being right. Or once, I took a quiz once and asked for my friend's opinion on a question and it help me get the right answer. Because if didn't ask their opinion I would have got the question wrong. Have you learned the benefits of asking opinions when making a choice yet? If you haven't, go ask a couple of people for their opinions in real life, the results might surprise. Because, your way of thinking may be a whole lot different from mine and somebody else's, it's good to get many people's opinion. Also, just because your opinion is not the same as somebody else's, doesn't always mean your wrong you just both look at it a different way. Having multiple opinions will probably lead you to a more realistic choice, or popular choice, or even the correct one.",
    "Knowledge, it is one of the most powerful things in the world. How do people gain knowledge? They gain information from their mentors, teachers, coaches, parents, and older siblings. People are always learning something new everyday, from how to do long division to how to make friends. The school districts are creating projects for students to do over the summer so they can continue to learn while out of school. some say that teacher-design is better and more effective student-design actually can benefit the students more by opening up their imagination and also expands their creativity. Summer is mean't for fun and laughter, not being kept inside all day working on a project the teacher assigned over summer break. The whole point of summer is being away from school and having a vacation. So wouldn't students prefer to do a project about something that they are passionate about? Indeed, studies show that when students do school work that they choose and are passionate about their work ends up being more creative and overall better performance. Students are just growing up and in school they aren't allowed to truly express themselves because they are either too shy or the class doesn't discuss their interests. Teenagers only want to do and listen to what they want, they don't want a teacher giving them homework over summer break not even to mention that it is not something they enjoy. students grow up doing what they are told by their parents and teachers. students grow up with an endless imagination and one day eventually it dies when they grow up to become adults. That is why a student-design project can end up being more beneficial than supposed to having a teacher assign the students a project where they aren't going to have fun and in the end will probably forget what the project was about. Students learn better when they do something that interests them and benefit more from that then to do a project about the presidents.\nHaving a teacher-design project has minimal benefits, that is why having a student-design project, which opens up great minds and can help students comprehend better what they are learning when doing something they enjoy.",

Also student can choose the time to they can star the classes because some students have to work in a job, so when is cold outside and students they don't like to come school,they can wort at home by the way of online or video conferencing students can be more responseble Some students feel good working at home,there is not streess for them,they can take a break,they can eat and his work. But also is depent waht classes student do you are,because some student are lazy when they work at home. Also parent can check his work in look if they do his work good or bad inconclution students have benefit from being able to attend classes from home.\u00a0 ",
    "Being a seagoing cowboy was much more than adventure, for me. I love being able to go out on the sea and have fun will helpping people with there problems make me super happy and I wouldn't have this job if my friend didn't tell me about it. For example (the world war11) I got to go to many places like China, Europe, and Italy.\nI was happy to help all this people with there problems and when we got to go on a ship, we had the opportunity to take turns to watch over the animals at night to feed them and to make sure that nothing bad is happening like fighting our the bottom of the ship is being filled up with water.\nSo I signed up to watch them and so I got the job. I had to stay up super late to watch them and to I went to tell the captin that every thing was okay and so on my way I slipped on some water and I fell.\nI had almost fell overboared but I didn't, thanks to a peice of meatel on the side of the boat and i was happy that I didnt die. I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and slidding down a latter. I soon recovered and was back to the job and so we took all the animals back to were they were.\nSo we made a game place were they were. We played a whole bunch of games and we did are ruiten, until we had another jod were we had to go get animals and watch over them. I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job.\nI wonder what are next job will be? Will I break another bone in my body? Can I survie another animal watch? Will I survie breaking another bone in my body? I don't know if i can survie another bone in my boby that can be broken?\nAfter about a month we get a call to go get some animals and so we went to go get them and I have to say it was a long ride to go to Teaxs and it was close to were my uncle lived and so we got there and there was a huge sand storm and so we had to go get alll the horses, and take them to the sea and then I relized that my uncle had this one horse and it did not like me at all. As we were getting the horses around I seen that horse. The captin asked me if I wanted to watch the animals that week and I said \", Yes I will'. So I was up all night watching all the horses and so I had to feed them. I was feed the one horse that hated me the most and it kicked me right in the neck as I was feeding him. I was out for a really long time and my best friend came down there and found me on the floor \"sleeping\". ",
    "Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students is very valuable! You can tell if they are interested in the current topic that is being teached, you can see if they are having a overall good day or bad day at school you can tell if they could be stressed out about something in particular. I think that it would be a good idea to use this in certain classes that are being teached with like new teachers, or with a new math subject that is currently really hard or easy to see how their overall current mood is at the time being when their face would be getting scanned into a 3-D model and constructs all the 44 facial muscles to see them clearly\n Next, in my own personal thinking it would be a good idea to tell how a student is feeling and I think this could save lives, if the student is feeling anger,disgust,fear & sadness and maybe distruction I feel as this could help set up counciling and help the student in need and get him back to a good and happy state to be in and nothing bad might happen in the future. \nThirdly, having the technology to tell if the student is stressed out at home or in the school work place is mostly the best idea to ever have to see if their are issues at home that is making him/her do bad on their school work. Next it would be good to have seeing a day before a test and seeing if students are worried about a test coming up the day before. Finally, I believe that having this technology in school could possibly improve grades and overall morale of the school and make it a better and happy & fun place to be at, instead of being the area where we childern frown on and dislike going. Next, I think that having this technology in the classroom seeing if the students are enjoying the subject is a good idea & you could see if their having a good or bad day at school which could save lives in the very long run finally, you could tell if the student is being stressed out or just worried before the day of the test. Overall I think that this would be a great idea to have in classrooms all over the United States and the Nation.",
    "Owning a vehicle or lisence is not what it used to be. people all across the globe have given up driving for the many benefits that come along with alternative methods of transportation. These methods can reduce pollution, be cost effective even improve people's well being and happiness. there is a surprising amount of options if you don't want to drive a car. Public transportation such as trains and buses exist in most major cities, especially in America and Europe. San Francisco is a busy city with many young residents, and many of these residents are not interested in getting their liscenses. \". . . They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.\" Because so many options exists, many people don't feel the need to own a car anymore. Similarily, some cities and towns have been made specifically to be navigated by foot, like Vauban Germany. Towns like Vauban are tailored to fit its resident's needs in everyway. \". . . In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main streer, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\" In Vauban, necessities are convieniently placed so that the town's inhabitents may acsess them with ease, rather than driving around the town.\n alternative transportation methods are not the only reason to give up your car. By not driving a car, air pollution can be decreased drastically . In Paris, France's largest city and international destination, driving was temporarily illegal because of heavy smog in the city. \". . . Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog.\" It did not take very long for traffic and smog to clear up once the ban was put in place, and the famous city began to look like itself once again. People are also happier when they do not drive cars \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\" sais Heidrun Walter.' ",
    "I have to say I do not agree on this possible policy change. I believe children who have grades below a B average should still be able to participate in school sports and other activities. B' s are considered above average. What about the average people, who really are trying? Can't they still do what they want to do? C' s are considered average I believe that \"average\" people with \"average\" grades should still have the opportunity to play in sports and other activities I can see how you think that sports may lower their grades even more, being too much of a distraction I know that physical activities are something that help the development of your body. Most Children have at least 4 to 5 hours after school to choose what they want to do. Even when these children are done with their homework they have free time and have the choice on what to do, which usually leads to T.V., video games, eating, computer... exedra. I think if these few extra hours lead to sports, it would be okay. If kids take the time and put in the effort to fit in sports and schooling in one schedule, I think that everything would be great School was never easy and sports never made it any easier, but at least these kids will experience something they may have been dreaming of doing for a long time. I propose that children with a C average or above in our school should be able to participate in activities and sports.",
    "So, in the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to indentify human emotions. After reading the article I really could'nt decide. When reading about the FACS the first thing that came to my mind was to use this technology on the faces of celeberties. Well it's because it would be fun to do so. In my opinion that's what it's most useful for in classrooms. Sure the teacher could use this technology to teach students about how advanced the humans have become but.. Imagine being a teacher and then one day you introduce the FACS to your students. What do you think the first thing they do would be? I think the first thing they would do is take selfies and let the FACS analyze thier face. Then they laugh at the results. See they are doing it for fun. This reminds me of disecting frogs in biology. Some students think it's useful for your education while some other students think it's a waste of time, a waste of life for the frogs and that disecting them in the first place is already digusting. But do they do this for fun. NO they don't. They do it to learn about the oragns of the frogs and the purpose of each organ. But is disecting frogs valuable? Yes in my opinion. So, no I don't think it's classroom valuable to use FACS. But that dosen't mean that you should not let them try it. Here's what the teachers should do. They show the students a picture of someones face. Lets just say for example Mona Lisa. The students will stare at the picture for about a minute carefully looking at every part of Mona Lisa's face. Then the students will decide Mona Lisa's emotion by rating her happiness, sadness, anger, digust or any other kind of emotions. Then after that the teacher uses the FACS on Mona Lisa's face to see if the results for Mona Lisa's emotions from the technology is the same as the results from the students. Human vs Technology there you go. ",

    "Some people thinks that the face on mars was an alien. Actually, it was the natural landform that formed on mars. Although it may looked like an alien, Scientists figured that it was just another Martian Mesa. After the rumors kept spreading that the face was an alien, Global Survey spacecraft revealed the Face on Mars for what it really is. First of all, Mars Global Surveyer flew over Cydonia for the first time with Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera. They snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos Then, they revealed that it was a natural landform, saying there was no alien monument after all. Since not everyone was satisfied Mars Global Surveyer drew close enough for a second look After that, they researched what the picture actually shows. As they looked, the picture was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which were landforms common around the American West. According to the picture, Mars Global surveyers figured that the face was just a natural landform. Lastly,\nthe above reasons and evidence shows that the face on Mars was just a natural landform. Furthermore, the face on Mars had played the most interesting role on Mars Global Surveyers, NASA, Scientists and us. Reason being, the fact that we all were curious about the face and had to figured out if the face was an alien or a natural landform. Therefore, the face on Mars was interesting. ",
    "When people ask for advice they go to many people, this can be incredibly beneficial to the person seeking advice. They can make a better choice by asking multiple people because they could get many different viewpoints and opinions. when your trying to get a good grade on an essay, you'll most likely ask multiple people to give feedback on your essay. It can make a big difference on the grade you get if you ask multiple people for their opinions on your essay. People will most likely have different feedback to give you about it, but if you ask a ton of people, then some of them might have the same advice for you. Asking multiple people for advice can really help with making a great essay, but it can also help with something even as small as deciding what shoes to buy. Back in 2017 I once asked multiple people for advice on what shoes to buy, I was torn between two shoes, Air Force Ones, and Jordan Ones. It was a tough decision, so I decided I would go ask my teacher about which shoe they thought I should get. My teacher told me that he preferred the Jordan Ones, but he advised me to get other peoples opinions so that I could make the best choice. I proceeded to gather my friends that also liked shoes, and the majority of them said that I should buy the Air Force Ones. I now knew which shoes I wanted to buy but I wasn't sure which color to get them in, so I asked my brother and my cousins which color I should get them in, they told me that I should get the white ones I was a little unsure at first because I was worried about how dirty they would get, but they eventually convinced me to buy the white ones. I'm glad that my teacher told me to ask people for advice, because it really helped me get a nice pair of shoes in a great color. seeking advice from lots of people lead to a better choice, another great example is when you need help deciding what extracurricular activity you want to participate in. Choosing what extracurricular activities you want to do can be stressful, hard, and sometimes even an annoying process. You might end up in a situation where you want to choose an extracurricular activity because your friends are doing it while other times you'll want to do an extracurricular activity, but none of your friends are doing it. If this ever happens to you it'll be important to ask people for advice on what to do. It might be confusing though asking people for advice on what to do because your parents will most likely want you to do the one where you are actually enjoying the activity rather than doing something you're not enjoying just to hang out with your friends. Your friends will probably be telling you to do the activity with them rather than the one with none of your friends. This is a key reason why it can be stressful choosing an extracurricular activity. Since your friends and parents are all telling you to do something different you'll need to ask someone else for advice. seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, whether it's as small as deciding what shoes to buy or as important as getting feedback on an essay it is always important to ask for more than just one person for an opinion on a topic.",
    "I think that policy 2 is the better policy because I don't understand the need for cell phones all the time I understand that you may have some type of emergency and if you need to contact your parents or other family members for help then I'm sure your school has a phone that you can use. If kids were given the right to have phones at school all the time, I am almost positive that they would not only use them during lunch and other free periods, but whenever they wanted to. They would listen to music and text friends that are in a different school or in a different room. This would cause them to get into trouble and also the person that they are texting would get into trouble. Having no phones at all is the best policy because without them there is less of a chance for you to get into trouble and having it taken away from you. There are less distractions and more time to focus on school work without a cell phone.\n",
    "There have been conspiracy theories going around that the Face on Mars is actually created by aliens, but it can be proven to everyone that the claims are false. The Face is simply a natural landform, and NASA is not trying to hide or distort the truth. Some may still be skeptical, there is proof that the Face is not an alien monument of any sort. As stated before, the Face is actually a natural landform It's the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa found commonly in the American West. Fellow researcher, Jim Garvin, even states that it reminds him of the \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\"(paragraph 12). It can be proven that Earth landforms definitely aren't made from aliens, and the same could be said for the Face. The Face isn't even an actual face, so it's unlikely it even is an alien monument The only reason the rock formation resembles a face is because the shadows cast an illusion of facial features such as eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Pictures of the Face were captured two other times using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Skeptics may believe that NASA messed up somewhere or that something was flawed, but it is highly unlikey that this is true. The procedure was performed on a cloudless summer day with the best camera at NASA's disposal. Some skeptics may still doubt that the Face wasn't created by aliens, believing that NASA is just attempting to hide the evidence of an ancient civilization In truth, this is false, but many defenders of the NASA budget wish there were signs of alien life How can one believe NASA is keeping secrets about alien life from the public when it would benefit to do the opposite. Proof of an alien civilization would be more helpful to share than hiding it, so why do people believe otherwise? Whether or not people believe the Face is actual just a Martian landform, it doesn't affect the researchers of NASA. Evidence to support the claim has been provided, but what proof do the skeptics have",
    "I think the Electoral college is a good way to vote for the president or vice president i think without the Electoral college, we wouldn't have anyone to vote for the president or vice president. We have each candidate running for president in our state and it has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the candidate political party. most state have a winner take all system because it awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The word state refers to the District of Columbia. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. We help choose our state's electors when we vote for president because when we vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our candidate electors. I think the best laid defenses of the system are wrong because some voters might sometime vote for the wrong candidate and they might sometime get confused about the electors. After Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, he won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. The disaster factor is the single best argument against the electoral college. I agree that most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidate don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidate at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina,and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. I agree that the it's official that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best agruments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. The agruments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right. Abolish the electoral college. I think the five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President was for its lack of democratic. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I disagree the advocates of this postition are correct in arguing that the Electoral college method is ot democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors because we're not actually voting for the president, we're just voting for the slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However it it entirely possibe that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections inn which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. I agree that they made the five reasons for retaining the Electoral College. ",
    "As a student you should let us bring cell phones to school. what if the child forgot to bring something to class and the need to call their parents and tell them, then they could call their parents and tell them to bring it to school. One advantage to this is that kids will not be blowing up the office phones to call home. The disadvantage is that there will probably be a lot of parents coming to the school to bring their kids stuff for class. As long as they don't use it in class you should let them to bring a cell phone to school. Another reason could be to keep them out of trouble. They would be texting or calling their friends instead of arguing or fighting during their free time, or whenever they get to use it. Even though most kids bring their cell phones to school anyway without permission, allowing them to bring it would be a lot better. Maybe you should consider my opinion and let us bring our cell phones to school.",
    "Summer is the time of the year every student looks forward to. Apart from socializing with friends, enjoying the fresh air, and participating in outdoor activities, students have the chance to assure their learning abilities through summer projects. Summer projects should be school-designed because it allows flexibility, it develops leadership skills it increases creativity. Student-designed projects allows flexibility during summer break. Generic_City's lifeguard program was very successful during the summer due to lifeguard availability. Being a lifeguard is a common job students pursue during the summer. Not only does it allow students to gain profit at a young age, but it also requires a high level of maturity and responsibility. Because it requires specific training and dedication, students must have the time to complete every task that is given. Having a student-designed summer project allows students to set their own study time instead of following a specific schedule that could intervene with working hours.\nIn 2019, the Pied-Piper Theater Association\u00a0successfully rehearsed their summer musical: West Side Story The Musical, due to the availability and hard work\u00a0of all actors. In West Side Story, the combination of performing arts and music are combined as one to produce an extraordinary musical. Rehearsing a musical is no simple task: lines must be memorized, choreography and blocking must be pristine, and every actor must be present on opening show days. A student-designed project over the summer can help students complete their required work in an flexible manner while still completing personal activities. Developing leadership skills for the future are offered through student-designed projects. Designing their own promotional plans, students from the Technology Student Association were able to pursue college business majors. The Technology Student Association allowed students to be completely in charge of their own work to get a sense of the leadership that is needed in many technology and business fields today. As a result, the ones who were consistent in their work and created their own designs were the most successful at the TSA regional competitions. Student-designed projects allows students to be in control and have the opportunity to manage work responsibly. Even though having a teacher-designed project can help in follow instructions and meeting deadlines, being ones own boss opens doors to many leadership opportunities to excel in the work field, and in ones personal life.\nPanera Bread employees that have shown leadership development have moved to higher job positions. In the food industry, like most jobs, employees must start off with a lower position and must enhance their abilities in order to move up to a higher position. For example, in Panera Bread, most new employees start of working as a cashier, dining room attendant, or produce worker; these minor positions prepare the employee with basic skills and prepare them for future duties. Later, when more experience is gained, employees move up to trainer or manager assistant. Similarly, student-designed projects help students learn to be self-sufficient and lead one another to success. As a result, future generations are encouraged to do the same. Student-designed projects allow students to show their full potential through creativity. Generic_School economics and finance teacher, allowed students to create their own budget plan presentation, discarding the teacher rubric that was given, to show their creativity. A typical power point\u00a0presentation a high school teacher assigns has basic requirements: a specific number of slides, easily-applicable pictures, and bullet point\u00a0information. However, when given the chance, students embraced their creativity outside the classroom environment and created sideshows, music videos, and drawings that still portrayed the same important idea any basic power point would for the assignment. As a result, the students who got lower scores on previous power points, increased their grade tremendously. Unlike teacher-designed projects, Student-designed projects has many varieties a student can choose from; students don't have to limit their potential to strict instructions. Instead, they have numerous ways to complete any assignment feeling more confident and fulfilled.\nGeneric_School International Talent Show showed how students from different cultures expressed their love and appreciation through creative attire. The purpose of International Night is to unite students together to celebrate their culture as one. For example, students from Peru dressed up with typical Peruvian dresses and hats and danced salsa, while students from France wore more formal attire and simply help their flag up proudly. Every student had a unique way of showing their performance to the crowd; the teachers had very little input on exactly how the students should perform and let their creativity run free. Even though a summer project doesn't exactly involve performing to a large crowd, students have the chance to show their creative ideas and opinions without any limitations. students have a unique way of showing their academic and social potential to the world Summer projects should be student-designed",

    "I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College \"winner takes all\" system It has been working well for the past couple of presidents. Yes, it might be unfair for thoses who are wanting to be electors and can't because the person they are running for lost but the ones who did win are doing what they believe is right. Just because of one big out break in 2000 doesn't mean the system will fail again. It will gradually progress trough out time and soon it won't ever fail again. You just never know unless you let it continue until it doesn't work any longer and when it does you find a new, better system that will work for decades. In 2000 people might have switched their votes because they thought that person desirved it not the other guy. The system of \"winner takes all\" hasn't failed since 2000. It works so why get rid of it. If it were to fail multiple times then yes get rid of it and find something new but it hasn't ",
    "I think that the new rules are kind of bad everyone should get there workout no matter what ! so kids can stay healthy. that's a students free time we get to run around and just be free instead of sitting in the classroom all day long. Instead of them rules I think they should make a better rule. So we don't have to dress for gym or something at least like that getting a B average can be hard to do sometimes if you don't like that pacific class or if your not good at that subject. I think if this does happen students would really be upset because almost everyone likes gym because we do a lot of fun stuff in there and everyone should get a workout so yeah.. I think having gym at school is the most important because that's the only free time we ever get while we are in school.\nIf we was to end up having gym rules where we couldn't participate only if we had a B average nobody would even want to go to gym because most people don't get A's and B's so the average of people not participating would be horrible!.",
    "Have you ever wondered about what would happen if you did something you knew that was bad, or good. What would have been the outcome. If you didn't really know then would't you ask someone like a friend, a family member, a trusted adult, or maybe all three of them. They would give you some sort of advice but it's not all the same sort of advice. When getting advice from different people they would tell you something they experienced or their biased on, but it would all give you some sort of idea.\n \nImagine you have a project to do about something, but you don't know anything about it. If you wanted to find out about you would go research. When you research you see all sorts of websites filled with information that you could use. When you open these websites you see that they don't all have the same type of information. When you keep reading these different websites you get an idea about what it's about. It's the same thing\u00a0with finding advice You don't get the same advice from everyone, but it gives you an idea which is the similarity\u00a0with all the advice given to you.\n \nPeople deal with all sorts of things. It could be a job they had, a problem they suffered from, a crime they made, a honorable\u00a0thing they did to the community. People had experience all sorts of things. When seeking advice, people first think of the experiences they had with that sort of topic. Then they tell you something based on their experience like what would happen, and what the outcome of it would be. People would say all sorts of things based on their experience because it something they experienced People could experience the same things but in different ways, which could create the idea of some sort of advice. Everyone has something that they like, it could be some sort of food, video game, bored game, book, TV show, movie, and sport team. Peoples opinion would be either they do like it, or they don't like it. They are reasons do like certain things, and there are reasons people don't like certain things People are just being biased on things. It's like when you get advice from multiple people. They would be biased on their advice that they give. when seeking advice from multiple people, they would all give you some idea of something, and how this happens is cause they all have different opinions but they all tell you something similar. How to know you are going to get some sort of advice that would really help. Depends on how much you trust each other, and how much you care for each other. People could just tell you whatever they want. That is why you should get advice form someone you know is trust worthy.",
    "Driverless cars are a huge step in technology and may workout to be very useful, but there is always that percent chance that it will fail. For example if I were to own one of these Driverless cars I would\nBe worried about one thing, and that is running into other cars. I wouldnt want to own one of these because I personally do not trust them. A huge problem for me would be liability. For example, If I am in one of these driverless cars and a surrounding car near me runs a red light and I go head on with them because this driverless car could not react in time because it doesn't have the senses of a human. If my life was not taken would it be my fault that I got into a wreck or would it be the manufacture's fault? Just like the article said new traffic laws will certaintly be needed in order to make this possible. There is a reason why only 3 out of our 50 states are currently allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars and that is because people do not trust these things. If these companies are releasing these cars in 2020 then they better change the law to make it safe for the driver and the companies by four years. I also do not think that they can make these cars as aware as some human drivers are. For example if the car gets hit it has nothing to lose, but the human inside the car is trying to protect their life. I personally believe that they should prohibit these cars from coming out in the United States. They could possibly release them in another country and then bring them to the U.S. if they workout in other countries. The reason for that is because our liability laws are not where they need to be yet in my opinion. ",
    "I don't believe the students would benefit from being able to do their work from home It would be harder for them to actually focus and get the work done if they are in their house trying to do the school work. Students are more likely to get distracted by things. They are also likely to get carried away or forget to do some or all of the work that is assigned to them. Then it would be harder for the student to be able\u00a0to ask or get help\u00a0if they do not under stand something that was posted or assigned to them. First off the students would probable be on their phone a lot\u00a0more and not focusing on the school work that needs to be completed. Also if they have a family member or pet in the house they will most likely end up playing with the pet or get carried away talking the person in their home. Students will end up turning the TV on and get distracted by watching something or play video games. They would just have a harder time with everything in their house to get things done. With all of these distractions they will most likely not do the work assigned.\n I think students will sometimes not do the work because they are gonna be all comfortable in their house and be to lazy to start or finish it Then a student is in a environment that they live in so they are gonna want to do more fun things then do some boring school work. Sense they have the ability to do the work any time they will just keep say I will just do it later and that will end up to them making plans and then the work never gets completed or turned in. Students would also be a little discouraged in doing the work because they do not fully understand the unit or what the work is asking for.\n How will students be able to ask or receive help on the task or the work they are given.\nMost students learn better when they have someone next to them teaching them the new unit. With them taking the work online they cant ask for help or questions because the teacher is not next to them or there for them. It's harder for them to get hands on learning experiment when the are at home behind a screen and most teachers say more things and help more in the class rooms. With all of these things coming into factor it would not be smart to let them do the work from home. I think students just need to come into school and get there work done in the environment that is set up for them to do work. Schools limit the destruction in the classes to help people get the assignments done and have them focused and less distracted in the class rooms. Also there are teachers and other workers there to help you so that you understand what the question is asking and so you are not lost and falling behind. When you come to school you are there to get the work done and finish it so you dont have to take it home and do it in your free time. I believe it is not a good idea to let students work from home.\u00a0",

    "I think that making students have at least a B in a class is a bad policy. It will make students less likely to try out for sports and some students need sports to be able to stay in shape. Also some students will do better in school if they have a sport to play to clear their mind after a long day at school For others it is something fun to do to get their mind off of the C and to put it behind them. Sports can also be a social thing and a C should not be able to take that away unless it is a parents decision. It can also be a good thing. It could get students to work harder at a grade to get to play a sport. It could get some students to help others out if they need them on the team so it would help both sides. It could even get coaches to get talking to kids about keeping good grades so they can keep playing sports. With everything I know i could say all in all it would probably turn out to be a bad policy in the end. Many students just won't care enough and eventually there will be no sport teams at all. Some parents may get involved and argue about it and possibly take their kid out of the school system. Below a C would probably work out better and would make everybody a lot happier. There will probably not be parental involvement and even students will like to be able to get one bad grade and still be able to play sports. If you compromise everybody will be happier and school and grades will be much more enjoyable.",
    "If you have an issue, speaking to more than one person can help you in many ways. This is because you can get multiple opinions, better outcome to your issue or problem One person who had a bad experience might give you what they did, making everything worse. This is especially true when the issue involves people. If you ask one of your friends, and they say yes to something you know is bad subconsciously, you should get another opinion. Once you go to another loved one, their added advice can lead to a better close to your issue. When you have a conversation with more than one person, you can get multiple opinions, different points of view, and different experiences . You can combine these into a chart, and then decide what to do. You might use a combination of things you were told. Getting multiple points of view on a topic can really help with your final decision. If you ask your mother, and she tells you something positive, but ask a friend, and they say something partially negative, you can put what they did together, and create your own solution. Different experiences is essentially the same as different points of view. Having multiple can help you to create your own solution, or use one that worked for someone else. Now that you know what you can do, who are you supposed to ask? The answer: anyone you trust Your mother or father are the best option. This is because you are the most comfortable speaking with them, and they've lived through most of the same situations. Next, is a trusted teacher/adult. These people most likely have experience with your predicament as well. If you have friends that you trust and support you, you can ask them about your issue. They may just be able to help. Regardless of who it is, you need to trust the person. getting many opinions on an issue can help you make good decisions, and create better outcomes to your issues. Knowing who you can speak to on these problems is very helpful as well. Having people that you can speak with makes you more confident in your decision making, so you can become an amazing problem solver. Using what other people know, and what you know can be put together to create the best possible solution. Help others when they ask you. You might not be the first person they ask, but at least they trust you enough for assistance.",
    "I disagree with this technology you can make all kinds of facial expressions it doesnt mean there is a certain face for one facial expression. We are all human but we arent same that is what makes all unique we have different faces for different expression. This technology that is being used is not going to tell you everyone is mad or sad, happy, angry. I dont have the same mad as someone else would so what i make one face and im mad? it could just be my face and the way i look and your gonna tell me that i am mad when you really dont have a clue. We cant tell if someone is mad or sad, depressed or even happy they have those feelings themself and sometimes people dont want others to know if there upset so then your just invading there privacy. That could just make things ten times worse than what it already is. There are things we want people to know and that we dont want people to know and its our decsion on whether we want them to know. So yes i disagree with this facial expression technology i dont think we should be invading others privacy that way i think we need to have way more respect for others than what we do now. ",
    "Many people seek advice from more than one person. It is something that we can do to ensure our information is correct, we are making the right decision, and we are respecting other ideas. But there can be positives and negatives, some of which may stop us from seeking advice at all. Asking for advice from multiple people can expose other perspectives about the idea that could have been forgotten about or unseen or one person could catch a mistake that another person or you didn't. people clarify their thoughts, ideas, and decisions it can help to catch flaws and errors. Asking for advice can make someone change their idea By asking for advice, we are showing that we are unsure and need clarity. So, by asking multiple people, it can help us to understand other opinions, ideas, and points of view that were never really thought about. These opinions can revise decisions and ideas and can stop us from doing something irrational. Advice has a positive affect and even if one person doesn't give the best advice, by asking multiple people you will fix the bad advice with someone else's advice. Asking multiple people is like going down and assembly line of revisions it may take time and understand but the end product will be perfect.\n Not having clarification could cause us to us to change our idea on our own and we may not see the mistakes hiding inside. Say you are writing a paper for school, only others can really see your mistakes, not because you are bad at revising but because if you read over it, you would see what you want to see. But when a fresh set of eyes looks over it, they don't know what the paper should be like and it will be easier for them to identify mistakes. This is another reason that advice is beneficial and will lead to a better end product. Having other opinions can expose mistakes and help us fix them.\n Asking for advice can also lead to stress from incidents such as getting multiple opinions that clash ,or doing one thing that one person would like but another person wouldn't. When asking for help, you will need to understand that you may agree with it or not but you can always try out different ideas and they could work for you. I once heard a quote, \"Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.\" This shows to push your boundaries and to try out advice that may clash with someone else's ideas or you are not really comfortable with Advice can be very helpful and it can be used to your advantage and will be beneficial to life because without it some a lot people would be in a harder place than the little added stress of multiple opinions. By seeking multiple opinions, people clarify their thoughts, ideas, and decisions and it can help to catch flaws and errors.\u00a0Advice is important for decision making and by asking multiple people, you will see what different kinds of people think of your ideas.\nAlthough asking for advice from many people can cause stress and more decision making, it can help us to see other sides of the story and could help us in the long run. Sometimes self clarity is key, but it wont hurt to get a little advice from a couple of other perspectives. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
    "New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy. This technology does sound helpful in the fact that it could gauge the state of mind of a student and help a teacher adjust their teaching methods to accomodate and keep their students students on track. The article did state that the techonology could identify when a student is \"confused or bored\" and then \"modify the lesson\" to keep a student engaged. In this way, the technology is useful in the fact that it adapts to the needs of the student. But what can this program do that a teacher's survey could not? By the way the article talks about how a \"home PC can't handle the complex algorithms\" and about how complex the system is, it makes people wonder just how much this system would cost and how complicated it would be to enstate said system into a classroom. Compared to a quick survey done by a teacher who asks their students how they feel about their methods of teaching, it is seen how the system would be a waste of recourses and money. Therefore, although this system is useful in the fact that it can gauge the emotions of the students, it is not much more useful than a teacher who can do the same thing by questioning their students on their preferences and ideas. Also, although technology is very much improved in these years, it is still not always accurate and infallible, and therefore may not be suitable for a classroom. The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education. Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been offputting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom. If this technology really can \"indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide. If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom. The Facial Action Coding System is a bad idea for the classroom, as it could incorrectly read a student's emotions and give a misleading output that puts a student off track in their education, and also because it could invade a student's privacy of their inner mind. Therefore, installing this system in schools would be a waste of money and recourses, especially when teachers can gauge how their students are learning by simply asking their students in an anonymous survey how they feel about their teaching methods. In this society, technology is used to fix almost everything, but in this case, scientists should quit trying to force technology on behavioral issues and just let humans interact so they can benefit themselves with communication, no computerized middleman needed.",
    "Do you think that the Unmasing face on Mars was created by akiens? Well my friens joe that i work with believes that the face on mars was. Joe and I are sciemtist for NASA, and we are here to discus the Unmasking face on Mars. So my friend Joe believes that the face on Mars was created by aliens. So here are some reasons why he believes hat he does on this theory. Joe said that \"Scientist figured it was jst another Martin Messa, comnmon enough aroung Cydnoia, only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyption Pjaraoh. \nJoe and I have different belifes, although I agree with him on this one. Only because, there are already Martin Messas around Cyndonia. But there aren't any like this thats has ever been seen before. I also think that all theses UNmasking face on mars are created by aliens or martins only because, the name Martin Messa. The Martin must come from the word Martian so they must have some typr on relation going on. Also at the same time i do not believe Joe becuase we have no proof or eveidence that this was really created by alines. Only beaucse we have no proof that aliens exsist either. I quit frankly think that this all rubish, but tbis is also my opianion i could be wrong. No one has proof of anything that has happened on mars. But then at the same time i still do agree with Joe, but at the same time i do not beileve with Joe. I know you are wondering why i am saything i agree then turn arounf and say i don't . Well once again here is why i do agree and don't agree. i agree becuase it make scence that out of nowhere there is an unkown figure of a face on mars, but at the same time we do not know who did it. So we jump top conclusions that it ahd to be an ailen . But we have nop prrof that an alien is rwal and we have no proof that any of thid is real. But these are just my opinion on hoe i feel aboiut this so i could be wrong i could be right, but unti we find out we have to continue to make obsevations on this until we find out the truth. So yeah that is how i feel on ths situation. ",
    "I honestly think that if your reconsidering the school's cell phone policy, then go with policy 1 I, think that it would be beneficial for both the students and the adults if you went with policy 1. If you let the students have their phones out during lunch and free time it would be beneficial in many ways.\n For one, if you decided to go with policy 2, you would most likely find a lot of students getting caught with cell phones. Taking away the cell phone privilege from students is bad and good in a way. Its bad because students wouldn't be able to communicate with their parents very well, so they would end up trying to hide it from the teacher, and getting caught in class and during passing time. It would be good because teachers would spend less time taking phones away, but actually teaching the class instead.\n Students do need phone time. Their parents might be trying to get a hold of them for an emergency, so if no phones are aloud, the student would never be able to return that call or text. If phones were aloud, that student would be able to communicate and return that missed call to that parents emergency or needs. Having a no cell phone at all policy would lead to many phones getting taken away and many other problems involving a phone. If I were the principal, I would go with policy 1. Policy 1 lets both the students and the teachers get their ways. Students would get time for their cell phones, and teachers would most likely find less cell phones going off in students pockets. The teacher also would get more time to actually teach the class, and actually have the students attention.",
    "Yes, I do think it's a good idea for computers to read students emotions. I think it's a good idea because some students might have suicidal thoughts or might be suffering from abuse It's always good to know what students are going through when they are sad. Alot of students dosen't like to show emotions or tell anyone about it. This Facial Action Coding system can prevent suicide.\n Everyone will not think this program is safe, and is envading privacy. But, this system can save suicidal people from all over the world. Prof. Thomas, Prof. Nicu, and Prof. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Emotions can be solved like math equations with this program.\n This program should be put in all computers over the world to help you with school work also. This new technology can also help you with your work like a teacher. If the computer reads that you are stressed then it could explain the question to you better or help you. This new technology program can change the world.\n I beleive that this program will spread on others and used by millions if this new technology is approved. This can be big help with teachers also. It could help them releive stress and give them advice or take a day off because of stress levels. It could improve humans and make them stress free. My incoclusion is that this program can help everyone with their problems and stressful moments. I think it's a good idea to read emotions and can prevent suicide. There is not a doubt in my mind that will make me change my final answer. Your face dosen't lie and this program will be able to tell it like a polygraph. ",
    "Communication is something that has been given to the human race ever since the first man was coined and has been ever so crucial for our development to how we are today. We come so far as to create a device to communicate at great distances with a single tap, this device is known as a cell phone. The device has gone through many alterations time after time to satisfy the needs of the average user. Cell phones are used on a daily basis and most spend up to nine hours a day, this behavior can be described as addicting. This addiction causes many people to not be aware of their surroundings which leads to many accidents; most of accidents occur on the road Drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones when in use of a motorized vehicle because it increases the chance for an accident decreases focus during the ride. Cell phones require much focus in order for one to operate it correctly, the same goes for using a vehicle so when you come across someone that is using a cellphone and a car at the same time, the chances of hitting something massively increases by almost 900 percent The obvious reason why so many end up in an accident is because if you're in a car traveling at 60 mph then that would suggest that for every second you don't see the road you miss about sixteen meters of distance, sixteen meters is enough distance for anyone to be involved in an accident. Safety councils report that anyone operating a cellular device while driving leads to approximate 1.6 million crashes per year. Most of the crashes are generated by younger adults who are just beginning to explore the world but end abruptly caused by the foolish act of using a cell phone while driving. Some states are now combating this problem by being stricter on what is allowed in during the ride and may lead to a chain reaction for all state's decisions. Government has had enough of all vehicle users to put innocent live at risk so they have passed bans for drivers so they would be punished if they are caught using a cell phone. About sixteen states have banned all drivers to have a cell phone in hand while in use of a vehicle including the District of Columbia, Guam, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. In Georgia, the law has been effective since the first of July last year (2018) and with the ban in place, less drivers are causing accidents because of the incentive to pay 50 dollars on their first conviction. This is a very good method for reducing the amount of people getting into crashes, it gives the tempting drivers to stop using their cell phone while driving. There are many more reasons why you should not use a cell phone during a use of a vehicle but these are two that could be major in rank.\n \nMany people use the skill that was given to us since birth and communicate with others around the world, it is very useful and can grow your social life as well as your culture. Many take advantage of this and use their cell phones while driving and putting many lives at risk including theirs, hopefully this helps other in grasping the seriousness of doing such action and will rethink how they drive. When someone calls you while you're driving please be smart and don't use your cell phone, this is why you shouldn't use your cellphone during the use of a vehicle. ",
    "Dear senator Im arguing in favor of keeping the Electoral collage. It has come to my attencion that people want to change it to election by popular vote for the president of U.S. I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it makes more sense and is easier for you guys to count the votes It is more orginized by level of the voting people lie president, vice president ect The Electoral vote consists of 538 electors. The most votes that are needed for being elected for president are 270 votes. Each candidate running for president has his own group of electors. The are generally chisen by the candidate political party so is fare. So Im sure that you are going to consider this and read it because some people dont thhink about it. Some dont know how it works and vote for a new one because it sound better but is not.\nI just want to make sure people are inform with. That they read this and tthink about it. This is only held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday of november. So you might not want to make a big mistake making this decision. People might think that this is not that big of a deal but it is. This very important for the president and the government. This only happens Every 4 year so you got to wait a long time.\n I am very imform about this and making a change will only make thinks worse. People are not going to get use to doing another way or they are gonna get confuse with the old one. It going to be a caus if you change it.",
    "A lot of people like to go do things on their own,but asking people for advice is a more effective way then trying to do everything on your own. The reason going to multiple people is more effective than trying to figure out everything on ones own people can get different perspectives, better explanations talk to people who are more mature and understand better. If a person tries something new they might be a little scared, it would be better to ask for advice from more than one person because that person could get there different opinions on the situation. A person could also get a better explanation because one may not help that person fully so another person might explain it better. When a person needs help they may be immature and not understand how to do certain things so when other people are more mature and understand better they might be able to help more.\n a person could get there different perspectives. That person will get to know how people look at things from their view and how they see it so then that person could take one of their perspectives and look at it as their own. Another reason would be more options, if a person had more options from different people it will make things a little easier to do things. If somebody has to speak in front\u00a0of a crowd they might have a fear of public speaking, so if they ask others who have done it before how they did it with such confidence they will have peoples different ways of how they overcame stage fright\u00a0and they could find which way works best for them and use it. Having peoples different perspectives on things really help because one will have more options and with that comes how others look at things and so much more with any of those things. they can get a better explanation A person might not be sure how to something so they ask multiple people because one did not explain good enough and left things out. When people don't fully explain things like a person wants them too or like they need them too everyone that person asked might end up putting everything they said together as one or one person may explain it deeper and get into more details than anyone else. A person might want to learn how to sail and their parents know how to sail, but they know other people\u00a0who sail better than their parents but their parents want to teach them so they could ask their parents to help them sail and anything that was left out they could ask the other people that they know. When someone gets a better explanation on something they don't know, it feels great to know that they know what they are doing and that they are doing it right.\n they can get advice from a more mature person . Age comes with maturity so if a person asked other people and they don't know then asking people who are older and who have more experience will mos likely mean that the person will get better advice. since some people have more knowledge than other people a person knows they will most likely be able to help more because that means they know more than you and can help more. A person might be getting in to trouble\u00a0at school and their friends want to help but don't understand why that person is getting in to trouble\u00a0so they don't know how to help but that persons mom is older and wiser so she understands why they are getting\u00a0in to trouble\u00a0and knows what to say and how exactly to help. If one talks to older and wiser then they will get better\u00a0advice from different people. Those are the reasons why talking to more people will help one more than just listening to them self\u00a0and only doing what they think is right. All of those reasons connect to each other\u00a0because if a person listens to peoples different perspectives then they will have a better explanation from more mature people. There are limits to why a person should take advice from multiple people, only that person knows them self\u00a0clearly so that's why sometimes people have a hard time listening to others. It is still better to take ones chances of failure listening to others trying to help rather than not try at all and fail with no fight. Those are my reasons for why people should take others advice and not just there own.",
    "I believe that yes we should keep the electoral college. To take it away would be wrong to me i have many reasons why and pay attention to find out why i believe we should keep the electoral college. To start off why wouldn't you want to keep the electoral college to me that's a sign of are freedom. The ones who don't know what an electoral college is we will get there soon just stick around. I am arguing that yes we should keep it because its important. The electoral college is the right to selecting/voting for president and vice president and people like that. Now to began on with the reasons i think it is important is that's a sign of are freedom to me that gives us a right to vote for who we want running this economy. Not being able to vote for this kind of thing could be bad because when we vote for the people we want running this economy we are choosing wisely because we don't want this town or anything to come crashing to the ground because of some man or woman who really doesn't care about the people they just want their name to be heard. Some may disagree with what I've had to say but they clearly didn't think about it to much. Also some people really don't care about who gets elected they just don't care nor do they wanna vote at all and most don't. When someone votes to me that's a good thing because we have went through all this freedom stuff and then were able to vote and no many people want to vote that's pretty ridiculous if u ask me that's a sign of freedom like I've said before and when we go through a lot just to get u this grant of freedom and people just throw it away that's a sign of disrespect. I know that me being young and not able to vote yet and probably not making any since at all is probably making who ever is reading this mad but i wasn't put here to be taken right back out at a young age i was put here to live a life that was chosen for me and when people who are to dumb to realize it don't vote or at least don't try makes me mad because their not seeing what there doing just going in there and putting what ever name down on a ballot is wrong but going in there knowing a little information and choosing the person you think would make a good leader is fine. People wonder why are world is so messed up and they don't realize it but its messed up because we made it messed up we had the choice to make it better but we chose to make it worse see taking away the electoral college is taking away are rights to make are community a better place and no one sees it but the ones who actually care and who are with me on this. People could show me a million articles on why we should do away with it but i will still agree with keeping because we didn't come this far as a community to just throw it all away and let people who don't care take away are freedom and rights to helping the community out and choosing wisely about are world and trying to keep are community as clean as possible and as safe as possible.\n Well you have just heard my argument on why i think we should keep the electoral college and not do away with it because some people just don't care. I know that who ever is reading this could think differently about what i had to say and they may be saying this fourteen year old has no idea what shes talking about and they may be right but i know that when my time comes to be able to vote i will be there and i will be choosing who i think will be the best and i will care.

    "Every teacher should use this in their class room because the teacher could see what each student is feeling inside Also the teacher could see if the student is learning,listening, or even liking what the subject is It says \"moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them''. I think that is very true and hopefully it would make people more happy and not feel like they are nothing. \n If people could make enough of the Facial Action Coding System for the schools all around the world. I think that would make a big difference on people not lieing about how the feel. It would help people be better with computers if the computers understand howthe person if feeling. It would me a great game too. You try to make the other person try to guess your emotion and the computer would tell you if they got it right or not I think this would be really good to get out to schools to show them how to see different emotions about people and like i said before, it would make a great game.

    "The author seems to be an advocate for studying Venus despite its dangers, and even gives some ideas as to how humans could study Venus without ever touching the extremely volatile surface. The author gives some examples of solutions that the people at NASA have found might be solutions to the problem at hand, and some reasons as to why exploration of our nearest planet is worthwhile. He talks about one of NASA's many possible solutions, saying \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" What he is talking about is a vehicle that would hover above Venus so it would never touch the surface. The reason why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is because \"it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" Even today it has features similiar to that of Earth, like its rocky surface, mountains, and craters Another possible solution to researching Venus while trying to avoid its harsh terrain is using old technology, used in World War II, and putting this old technology into a new use. The author says the reason these might help the future of exploring Venus because \"Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.\" these might be more resistant to whats in store for them on Venus. While the challenges of visiting Venus are certainly disheartening, the value of visiting and exploring Earth's \"twin\", and one of its closest planets is impossible to know, but the pursuit of knowledge of the planet would make it a worthwhile endeavor. The only thing we know is that impeding danger can not stop our thirst for knowledge, and may even spark it.",
    "The Electoral College was created with good intentions, but it has many vital flaws which allow for very unfair outcomes. The electoral college is an outdated, and irrational way to choose the president of our country for the next four years you can win the presidency with a mere fourty percent of the country in support of you You can completely ignore some of your voters, as you're guaranteed to either win or lose heavily biased states, and you can gain massive numbers of electoral votes due to one more vote for a side in a state count system even allows for massive corruption to go unpunished, which is one of the biggest offenses in our country. The electoral college's biggest flaw may perhaps be its ability to elect a president that doesn't even appeal to half of the country According to source two, Al Gore \"won the popular vote but lost the presidency.\" Al Gore had a signifigant victory in popular vote for the nation, yet still was denied presidency due to the electoral college's vote assignment system. If we did away with the electoral college, each and every person would have an equal say, and would be equally important to the candidates.\u00a0 Even source three agrees that the trust in our electors is occasionally betrayed, albiet rarely. \n Republicans have a strongly biased voter base in the south - so much so that generally speaking, the Republicans never have a single rally or major ad. According source two, states like South Carolina almost never vote Democrat. It's so rare, that if you lost, you offended the group that has voted unquestioningly for your party since the system has been put into place. If the electoral college system didn't exist, the thirty percent of southern Democrats would have a say, which would make advertising and campaigning all over the country much more vital. The electoral college system also allows for an astonishing amount of corruption with no punishment If a state manages to vote one hundred percent Democrat, rogue electors can still cast their vote for the Republican candidate - and this isn't against the rules. We're essentially putting the next four years of our country into the hands of 538 electors, and holding them to the lowest possible degree of accountability. Again, source three clearly states \"and that trust is rarely betrayed.\" While it's rare, it's still more than possible, and can be quite disasterous. \n Some may argue that the electoral college system puts into place a system of certainty and safety, for both the candidates and the people This, however, is quite far from the truth. According to source three, \"the residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised.\" While this source claims that ignoring biased parts of the population, this is quite far from the truth People are being entirely ignored by the powerful politicians that are supposed to represent them. That doesn't sound very democratic and fair to me. People begin to feel discouraged and that their vote doesn't count, and this is quite close to the being the case. Only one-half of elligable citizens voted in the 2012 election, which means that one half didn't. Half of our country isn't bothering to vote in the elections because the electoral college system completely negates their vote. Our country prides itself on being \"the land of the free, and the home of the brave,\" yet our people are being discouraged at every turn by our government. The popular opinion of our people is that the government is out to get us, and there's not much evidence to contradict that. The electoral college system allows for the government to be run by men who didn't fairly win over our country, and isn't accurately representing our views. It's rife with corruption, and allows money to buy power. If we remove this system in favor of a popular vote election would encourage more popular policy, make our government closer to the people, and have little to no negative impact on our country. ",
    "Imagine you get a letter from the principal of the school. It says that students must participate in extracurricular activities. You think to yourself my kids should do that they need to get out of the house. You say \"oh man my kids need to get a life.\" We should have students participate in at least one extracurricular activity they learn about\u00a0the activity the're doing and how it will affect them getting jobs they learn to work in teams, they can make friends If we have students participate in extracurricular activities they will get an idea of what it's like to work in that kind of job. An example if you're helping make the year book you get to learn how to use editing software. kids wouldn't get this opportunity\u00a0if they never wanted to do it in the first place. But, if it's mandatory you wouldn't need to worry about this because the school would do you a favor. If your kid doesn't\u00a0want to do it the activities eventually get better and more fun so it'll rope them into it.\n If your kid is shy nothing is better than getting them some experience\u00a0with talking. They'll be doing a lot more talking when they join an activity they'll never wanna leave. They get to work in teams and talk to each other and have fun. whenever they get into the real world they'll need to know how to work with people. It may be hard for them to listen to that much talking but it builds their endurance to withstand that amount of talking. Did i mention they can also make friends if schools don't make you do those activities most kids won't have friends. It's really hard to make friends but if you're seeing the same people everyday during those activities you form a bond. If you don't want your kid to have friends you can always tell them to not make any friends. But, whats the harm in making friends. They can make friends if you want them to and it'll be a lot easier to because you're close to other people. we should have students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they get experience in the activity the're doing, they learn to work in teams, and they can make friends. Extracurricular activities help kids get an idea of the job they want. It's a good place to learn how to work in teams and communicate\u00a0with each other. You can make a lot of friends there by working with your team. Would you want to join an extracurricular activity if it was mandatory?",
    "The using of cars has caused much of the worlds green house gas imitions, in America as much as 50% of the imitions are caused souly by transportation. Many people feel that this is destroying our atmosphere and that we should cut down on imitions by walking, biking or car pooling. Efforts to cut down keep our atmosphere clean and breathable. Some communities such as Vauban, Germany have illiminated car use entirely. Vauban is a new experimental suburb where there is no street parking or driveways and the only place to park is in a garage where you must buy a space for 40,000 which has cut the car ownership rate down to only about 30%. There are as many as 5,500 residents in Vauban and most of them say they like it much better without having to worry about a car. In many suburbs however the houses are much to far apart for them to be car-free, though many areas are considering developments like this one so they can clean up the air. Other cities, such as Paris, are fourced to ban driving for days at a time in order to clear the thick smog that hovers above the city. On one day odd numbered plates won't be allowed to drive and on the next day even, volaters are fined $31. As many as 4,000 drivers are fined. Only once the smog was sufficently cleared did they allow both plate types to drive. Limiting driving can prevent problems like this from occuring in all cities. In Colombia they have a day where all cars are banned, chalanging the inhabitance to find alternate routs of travel for fear of the $25 fine for violators. The day without cars began in the mid-1990's for Bogota, a city with a population of 7 million, has participated, but last year two other cities in Colombia joined in. Dispite the rainy weather many people still hiked or rode their bikes. Many citizens say that it keeps the cities air clear and that its nice to have a day without traffic jams filling the streets. The Day without cars is an event that many countries hope to adopt. Studies show that many people from the newest generation aren't bothering to get a licence. Cell phones and apps make car pooling easy and the internet allows you to interact with friends without having to drive to visit them. Experts are hoping this trend will continue and that it will cut down the gas imitions. With increased use of social networking technology hopefully people will also become more aware of how they are affecting their planet and move to help others cut down as well. ",
    "I firmly believe that we should keep the Electoral College. Many people say that it is \"outdated, irrational, and unfair\" but that is an opion.\u00a0 Their are meany rational reasons about why the Electoral College is benificaial rather then destructive. Everyones President Swing States. \n \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-reginal appeal.\u00a0 No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" In PLumers article he states that, \"candiadtes dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the the tight races in the \"swing\" states. The Electoral College assures that the President isnt just wanted in one area that is wanted all around the country.\u00a0 Electoral Colleges assure that the President is wanted in many differt parts of the United States. Some people argue about the Electoral College turning off potential voters, but this may actually determine the election.\u00a0 If those other party people dont vote who knows mabey if they had voted their party might have been luckly.\u00a0 Statistics prove that when certaint parties win contriversial states thats because some people from 1 party didnt vote. No voting especailly in swing states can make your party, or your wanted candiadate loose the election.\u00a0 Every year some of the swing states change so everyone should vote especially those in the swing states to insure your party or your candidate win. The Electoral College is something that this country needs for our benifit.\u00a0 It helps us Americas get a President that will benifit us all not just those in certaint areas.\u00a0 Although some peopel dont think that the Electoral College is helping there are twice as many people who believe that just a popularity vote is a bad idea.\u00a0 Having swing states, and having a way that finds \"everyones\" president are just few of the many exaples about why we need the Electoral College.

    "Do you really think student's would like to complete summer projects over the summer? Me personally i would hate to even think about having some type of extra work in the summer, I know sometimes in the summer, were bored and can't wait to start school there's times where we want summer to hurry up and come around, because were drained mentally, physically, and emotionally because of the thought, we have work to finish up, make sure you turn it in on time before the due date and focus on maintaining to keep your grades looking good and not disappointing,. no teacher nor student would like to do a summer project over the summer. Because i know some people can't go out, hang out with friends because their parents are too stricked; or they're furious about letting their kids out at a certain time even though they can have a bed time but some parent's just can't risk anything i'm talking out of experience because my parent's are like that, it's not fun at all. But honestly you'll thank them later on as you get older or when you have kids because, how society now days is set up is crazy! , i tell you. Then, we started school, for example \"September 4, 2019\" is the first day we enrolled in school then give it a few months into the school year \"January 11, 2020\". let me tell you, the first day of school was memorable, seeing the pleasant faces of missed friends and teachers was probably the best, but as soon you get later into the year it's not so jolly anymore, your're DRAINED the feeling that you just want to drop out, give up, you dress like you don't love yourself because of the amount of stress on school work, the end of year state test's, so you can't help but to say \"I can't wait for summer\" out of your mouth most defiantly not the teachers nor the students, we have been learning for months and i know teachers are sick, tired and cant wait to catch a break, don't get me wrong we need to gain knowledge everyday but after all the months we've been learning and teachers staying after to grade our papers and assign are next assignment when we come in class is a call, a call that we need a break. The moral of the story is no, no i don't think teacher's nor student's should be required to complete a summer project over the summer, it's too much for them and i'm\u00a0pretty sure their brain needs some type of break, you know? vise verse. I hope the schools that require this assignment should think about there decision\u00a0a little more. Respectfully. \u00a0 \u00a0",
    "I think the driverless car is a waste of time you do not even get a insure that your safe when you get in the car. In the text it states in most states it illegal to test compuer made cars. What driver would want to be in a csr thats not even tested to see if it does not shut down on commands or to notify if you are in danger of getting hit or close to backing up on a car.\n The car can not even drive on its own around construction sites or around heavy traffic jams that what type of car people would buy without question. If the car can not move around or hit the brakes when your in serious danger than why even get it. Its jus a waste or your money and time and you can not inusre your safety. The biggest thing that about the cars is you do not even know if you can sue the company for car failure. I believe the only the car good for giving your leg a rest from the peddle but that what we have cruise control for. The car is junk and have no need for people daily life and should not be out for a drive. alot of people will get hurt or worse for a untested car thats legal on the street. ",
    "I believe that the principal should go with policy one and allow students to have cell phones at school. Yes i think that you should let kids have cell phones at school and no do i think they should be allowed to use in class. Students should be allowed to have cell phones but only during lunch or there free period. I agree that the cell phones need to be turned off in class so it does not distract students from there school work. Teenagers will enjoy school more if they are allowed cell phones in school. Now if the texting begins to be a problem in class then i think you should take away the rule and allow no cell phones in school. But i doubt it will be a problem since teenagers love there cell phones and do not want them taken away. Teenagers like to communicate over text so if one doesn't know where the other is then the can text each other and get together. Another reason is that students will need to call parents or other students to get a ride home or if the parent is late picking them up they can call them and know where they are and why there late without worrying about getting there phones confiscated. Well that sums up why i think you should allow students to have cell phones.",
    "Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving.\nAccording to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone puts drivers at a four time greater risk of a crash. Despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to always be available and keep in touch with other people Also, they think that a hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. However, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\n Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to a tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to losing control over the car. \"Even though we as humans recognize that talking or texting on a cell phone or using social media apps while driving is unsafe, they often engage in these behaviors anyway\"(Foss and Teft). So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people. Opponents also say that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Research shows that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. \"In 2017, distracted driving was reported in crashes that killed 3,166 people (8.6 percent of all facilities), although many instances may go unreported\" (Foss and Teft). It's also proven that people talking over the phone image of the person who they are talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrians step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time which may cause an accident because of lack of manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time. Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is an illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in a car. \"Texting while driving is the most dangerous activity on the road, even more dangerous than drinking and driving\" (\"Injured in a Car Accident by Someone Using a Cell Phone\"). People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable.\"You cannot drive safely unless the task of driving has your full attention. Any non-driving activity you engage in is a potential distraction and increases your risk of crashing\"(Andrew Currin). Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations . Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives.\n",

    "Our world is becoming more and more automatic. Everyday things that people use to take an hour to do can now be done by a machine without any labor involved. This can make things easier and seemingly better, until something goes wrong. These ways of doing things automatically have hidden problems that are not good about them, much like the driverless car. Driverless cars are not a good thing the extra cost, the complicated maininence, the possible safety hazards. The radar on the top of these driverless cars cost 200 million dollars to devolope, as stated in the article. That is just more money added to the cost of these cars. That is not even counted the many more electronic softwear that has to go in these cars in order for them to drive themselves. As many people know, electronics are expensive these days, and adding a whole bunch more to these driverless cars will make the price skyrocket, which is why I am opposed to them. When people are driving their own car correctly and how they should, they can see everything around them, and if something were to go wrong, they can manuever however they want to in order to avoid the problem at hand or stop it as soon as possible. Also, there are so many things to take into acount when driving. Such as the sudden moves of people or animals or other cars, and a person can also adapt their driving in certain weather conditions, which was not mentioned about the driverless car in the article. If there was no way that someone could avoid an accident and they had to drive into a ditch in order to get out of harms way, there would not be alot of damage done. the cost of the extra electronic parts of these cars is more than enough to dislike them, but now emagine if one of these parts were to go out, now your self driving car cannot function properly. Fixing electronic problems are very expensive, as sensors for various vehicles today can cost over one thousand dollars. And we are dealing with more complicated technology than just a single sensor. These electronical problems are the most complicated to fix, and that means that they cost a whole lot more to fix than a normal, easy mechanical problem like a spark plug. Why can't people just sit back and enjoy the ride and the pleasure of driving? If taught correctly, this is the safest bet. The cost of electronics for a self driving car are very expensive, and a human driver that is aware of his surroundings and how those surroundings react when driving is far more safe that a self driving car. The maintenence of the expensive electronics will be a mechanics demise when one of these magic cars come rolling in the shop. Which is why I am against self driving cars because of the extra expence, the risk in safety, and the cost of maintenece.",
    "The electoral college in many peoples eyes is a good thing but, there is a majority of other people who would much rather have a more direct vote because all though one president got the popular vote among the voters, the electoral votes count differently. One direct vote could count for ten votes or it could count for two votes and most people would rather have their vote count as just their vote. Electoral votes in a lot of peoples minds is just unfair all around. One president could be the favorite among the voters but the electors the president has to back him up with electoral votes could maybe not be as big as another presidents electors and its pretty much, in many peoples eyes, giving the least popular among the people president an easier way to become president. Adults that vote like knowing that their vote really counts for the person theyre voting for. That is why people would much rather have a direct way of voting than the electoral college which is taking one vote from one person, and say there are thirty electors in that one slab for the person you voted for, and giving that person thirty votes for the person they want elected. People find this way of voting unfair because they dont like the fact that the person they voted for could get the most popular votes, but the number of electors there are for the person is not very many, so their votes count as less than others do. Many feel that they are being deprived of their right to vote because one person could be voting but they get 10 votes while another peson could be votin and only get 6 and its not equal for all people. \n People who vote for a president that gets the most popular votes, and they dont win the election, can start big disputes among the way the elections are carried out. When a president wins only the electoral votes and not the popular vote, many dont feel like they are actually their president. Most people would prefer direct voting because it actaully makes everybodys votes count equally and everybody has equality. Winning electoral votes doesnt show that you won because the majority of people wanted you to win, it shows you have many supporters to give you more votes through the electoral college Direct voting would be a better way to vote so that everybody felt like their votes really counted towards who they voted for and that they arent getting cheated because one president has more electors supporting them. The electoral college is not based on equality because everybodys votes count differently due to supporters or electors who are pretty much the ones getting the votes. fixing the way people vote and how they vote can change the way some people feel towards the preident no matter who they are. Let the people vote for who they want and not the electors because it would make more people more open to vote than there are now. ",
    "The electoral college needs to be kept, it is the easiest way to vote for a presidential canidate People may not like it because the people who are voting for a president really are not voting for the\u00a0 president, their voting for the electors to vote for the president. Which makes sense but the electoral college is simple and yet very reliable in many ways people dont see. The electoral college is based of popularity in a state. I\u00a0 can see why people dont like that because certain states like florida has the maximum of 29 electoral votes, but wyoming only has a maximum of 3 electoral votes. The presidential canidates look for states that have the most electoral votes, but they also need more votes than the other canidate so every vote counts. Citizens may think that the canidates dont care about their state, but they do in more ways than you think The electoral college has a requirement, trans-regional appeal, which means that a canidate is popular in a certain region of the U.S for example, Mitt Romney he was the most popular in the south in 2012's election. Romney did not canpain heavily in the south so he did not gain any electoral votes by increasing his popularity in the states he knows he would win in. The electoral college is definatly something to argue about but in my opinion it should be kept. The Electoral college may seem a bit unfair but its also the most easiest desion making tool when it comes to electing. Its been around for years it would make no sense to get rid of it. ",
    "Drivelss cars should not be developed because they can cause accidents they can cause the driver not to pay attetnion, and they would cost more. In paragraph 9, the text states \"most driving laws focus on keeping dirvers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.\" The sentence proves that driveless cars may not be completely safe. The driver could depend on the car to drive itself and not be paying attention which can result in accidents. In paragraph 9, it also states that it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. Something would not be illegal if it's comepletely safe. Driveless cars would be like phones. They made driving and texting illegal because it made the drivers not pay attention and caused many death and accidents. The same result can come form drivelss cars. They can be a great distraction becasue the driver would think that the car can drive itlsef and they would not pay attention. \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer\" Who would be responsible? If the driver belived the car can drive itself and the techonology failed, it can lead to death because the driver might not be paying attention. The driver would think the car doesn't need a driver and when the techonology fails and the car spins out of control, many lives could be lost. The cost to buy would most likely be more expensive. If drivelessc cars started being in use, there would need to be new signs that fit those specific cars. Driveless cars would aslo need specific shops and equipment. If something goes wrong you would need to get it fixed and the technology used makes it more expensive. Fixing a car is already expensive. You have to buy whatever it is you need to fix and then take it to a shop. If something in the techonology of a driveless car goes wrong and you need to get it fixed, it will denifitely cost more. Causing accidents, causing the driver not to pay attention, and costing more are reasons why driveless cars should not be developed.",
    "Today my firend Don Reist inviited me to come with him to the Seagoing Cowboys program he wanted me to go and tought about and Want to go mainly becaues I was 18 and out of school and i can get dafted to the army.\nDon telled me that since the war was over we go to this other country and help them out a little sice it was a big mess over.\nIt was August 14, they reported us at New Orleans. When we got there they were giving out thing to do before the ship got there they said for me go get more peole to do this program and I did. I walked down to the bordwalk got a big line of people the fun thing was that if you get to convince eveyone who does not want to go then they just go some were real nice and just went but they were probalry going to be dafted like me.\nAugust 15 the cattle boat was not there so, they said do the same thing again the same thing happend got a lot of people then they gave another job that it is to see wich man was strong enough to go they said i got to much people so, we get the strongest of the strongest two hour went bye and when eveyone was at lunch the boat was there .\nAugust 16, I guess sleeping in a boat is the same thing as sleeping in a bed room but the bed was always moving but I can't lie about spleeping good last night. tonigth was a big night for me I was a wachtman .

    "Fighting, drama, bullies, and irritated teachers are all factors of attending public school. We live in a society where social anxiety and depression are now a common problem. Everyday, somewhere in the world, a child is diagnosed with anxiety. Attending a public school can worsen the symptoms of the mental illness. Anxiety can have major effects on your body including; panic attacks, depressive spells, anger outburst, crying episodes, and nausea. Drama and fighting can be an easy trigger for a student with the mental illness, and for an unknown reason, public schools have a lot of drama. Most drama comes from bullying, the popular girls give the smart girls a hard time. The typical teenage \"movie\". Bullying is a serious matter, we lose at least 10 children a day due to bullying. When someone is mean to you over and over again, you begin to believe that it is your fault, which can cause negative thoughts in a young persons mind. The suicide rate in the past 20 years is higher than ever. Most of the recorded suicides have to deal with bullying Doing classes from home sounds like a positive way to keep physical bullying at a minimum. I understand waking up early, not getting enough sleep, didnt get a chance to have your morning coffee, or even you're still a little bit sleepy can have a negative effect on ones attitude. I believe teachers suffer with this reality more than the students. Their day can begin as early as 5 am!\nSchool usually starts around 7am-8am, and when students arrive, some carry mean and ugly attitudes with them. The often take out stress or anger from other things on teachers who are already not having the best of days. In return, if being sent to the office isn't occurring, teachers will scream and fuss at the class causing a chain reaction of bad energy. Doing online classes doesn't sound half as bad when you hear you get to go to school in your pj's. I remember having \"spirit week\" at school, and we would have special day where we did different things. My favorite day was always \"Pajama Day\". Remaining comfy and calm can relieve stress from a student, which is why school from home sounds like a pretty good idea. In school, there are more than just you in the building, which means moving at your own pace isn't really an option. Students get extremely irritated when they feel like they are being rushed in or out of a subject, which can cause a lot of hostility or sadness I believe this can take a lot of the stress school applies away. I do understand that with doing school from the comfort of your own home comes with some cons as well, such as shielding children from a reality they soon will face. I am also aware that not all children have such access to these things such as; WiFi, a laptop, school supplies at home, or a good support system at home. I do believe that the \"one-on-one\" time a child will receive is extremely beneficial. The student will not have to worry about being left behind or being confused. They will have the time to understand while working at their own pace. Allowing the student to have a peace of mind, not worrying or struggling in school. In conclusion, the whole idea of school from home has both positive and negative outcomes. I believe it will help decrease the anxiety rate, and suicide rates of younger adults. I also believe it will help the graduation rate rise higher than ever. Students and teachers will have more time with family, friends, and themselves. Following the decision of home school, the time it takes the average student to complete school could be changed. Instead of the 12 year average it could be shortened due to the pace students work at with one on one education. The system definitely will have a better success rate with the homeschooling idea at hand.",
    "In this article, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\". Many people believe that this imprint of a human beings' face was sculpted by aliens In this essay, I will provide many reasons why this imprint was just a natural landform that looked identical to a human face. Scientist have discovered that this \"Face\" on Mars was just a natural landform. Many people are trying to say that the face was created by aliens There are many ways that we could prove that aliens DID NOT create this fasinating landform From far away, this imprint looks exactly like a human face. If you focuse hard enough on this sculpture, you could indentify its eyes, mouth, nose and head shape.\n One of the many reasons that this artifact was not created by aliens is because, provided in the article, back on April 5th, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Scientist studied the artifact from afar, yet, they were still able to see the face. One of the scientist, Michael Malin, and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took pictures of this marvelous sculpture As Michael looked closer into each picture, he discovered that the creation was not carved that way in any sort. He discovered that the artifact was just a landform that began to age that way. Another way to prove this artifact was not created by aliens is, there was no one there at the planet Mars Scientist looked all over the planet, circled it for a long period of time. There was no foot prints, or any marks on this planet. Many believed that no matter how hard they searched, the solution would come out possitive. No one came and created this impressive land. In the passage it says on April 8, 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Each pixel spanned about 1.56 meters in 2001. The best Viking photo in 1976 was measured out to be 43 meters per pixel. This is when they knew for a fact that this landform was not something anyone else was able to make. This was all just a huge coincedense that there was a face imprinited on our called, \"Red Planet\". This is why we should believe that \"the Face\" was just a natural landform. All facts has proven, that this creation was just part of Mars. There was no clear explaination that an alien would come and create this. If aliens tend to exist, there's no possible way they would know the facial structures of a human face. ",
    "When making decisions people often look to others for advice. Whether the decision be where to go for lunch or something that would alter your life people seek others opinion. Often times going to more than one person to get advice can be a very beneficial thing to do. Getting more than one opinion can be very helpful since it gives you more outlook on the question at hand By asking more than one person you get multiple sides of your situation their past experience in doing something similar in the end you will be more confident in your final choice. Going to other for advice can really open your eyes to all sides of your dilemma. Perhaps you want to apply to a school and are having a hard time deciding whether to apply or not. Asking someone who may have gone to that school or had experience with something like that would be helpful because they know what its like. Then for another opinion talk to someone close to you like a friend or a family member to see if they think it would be a good fit for you specifically. These people also may see things that you dont in a situation. Seeing multiple sides of the decision in question really helps to make a clear decision. Some of the people you would want to talk to probably have more experience than you do. This would be optimal considering they have already gone through something very similar and know which choices have a bad outcome. A family member, close friend, or anyone you trust really would be a good option for this. If they are older than you its likely they had to make some similar decision\u00a0and will relate to you and your situation and try their best to help aid you in making a good choice. These people that have more experience in life and are willing to help you really make the difference and help you make the best choice possible. After asking all these people and taking into consideration all of their opinions there should be a pretty clear final decision. Since you've asked all of these people you should be able to confidently make a good choice that will benefit you. Going into something like a job or a try out is optimal for success. All in all more opinions makes a stronger and more sound conclusion to the problem at hand.\nAn example of this from my past experience would be when I tried out for junior varsity softball at Generic_School. I wasnt sure if trying out was gonna benefit me at all considering i'm in 8th grade and many of the girls out there have many more years of experience. I went to my dad for advice since he played junior varsity and has also seen me play. In his opinion he didnt think I should try out because its a lot to take on during 8th grade. Then I went to some of my friends for their opinion on it and they gave me the confidence to go and try out. Right now Im on the softball team and very happy with the choice I made to try out. asking more than one person for their opinion on a problem is very beneficial. By asking more people you can see all different sides of the question. These people have different experiences which could cause them to see things that you cant. Having all of these different sides should make it so your final decision is something you can be happy and confident with. ",
    "I can see why you can think that \"the Face on Mars\" is some form of proof that either alien life did at one time or is still cuurrently on Mars . The human mind is meant to think, imagine and wonder \"what if\". Let's say these \"aliens\" are in fact real and constructed \"the Face\" in order to communicate with us. Carving a giant face has got to be one of if not thee least effective way of dong so. \nThese \"aliens\" very well could have simply just put a peice of shiney metal on the surface and the MGS would have seen it and we would probaly think \"hey, this unknown element is here on the surface of a planet where there are no metals\". Not only would it make us think that there is indeed metals on Mars but then we would think \"hey metals most usually form deep undergroud so there is no reason for this to be on the surface\". THAT would be a valid way of letting us know \"hey, we exist\".\n Also another thing, if \"aliens\" made \"the Face\" how is it no footprint s were found. And there's no wind on Mars they coulnt have blown away. Seriusly, that's a big project so you're gonna need a lot of your alien buddies to help you out with it and no footprints....hmm. Well hey,maybe they have got giant eagle wings and fly everywhere. Yeah, on a planet that HAS NO GRAVITY! Let's face it though (ha, face, get it?) everybody loves a good \"supernatural \" story. I believe that this is nothing more. \"Once in 1976 a NASA spacecraft was looking for a place to land, and there on the surface they found... a huge human's face carved out of the surface Mount Rushmore style....wooouuh\"\n The very thought that \"aliens\" somehow carved a face onto Mars is ridiculis ",
    "Scientists have been studying Venus for generations, wondering what could possibly be on a planet so close to ours. Now that we don't have to wonder anymore, NASA will try to take it one step higher. They want to be as close to Venus' ground as possible, without dying.\n Their plans are to use a blimp-like vehicle that will withstand the great amount of pressure and heat. It will fly thirty miles above the Venusian landscape, avoiding any ground conditions that would do them harm. It would still be 170 degrees F., but they would have an abundance of solar energy, and the radiation woud not exceed Earth levels. However, in order to learn all there is about Venus, you would have to go onto Venus. This is almost an impossible task though. There are many dangers on Venus, including sulfuric acid rain and an atmosphere of nintey seven percent carbon dioxide. Hovering over it would be useless. In paragraph six, it states, \"... peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.\" This states that by hovering on top of the planet, they can't learn anyting they don't already know. My honest oppinion on this topic is that we should not be exploring Venus right now. We just don't have the right technology for it right now. We need to wait however many years before we can officially explore our sister planet. Trying to figure out its secrets now would just be a waste of time, money, and possibly lives. We shouldn't risk a human being just because this planet used to be like ours millions of years ago. ",
    "This policy is unreasonable it is because some kids that love sports only have a c average and are trying their hardest Also when you take away sports and other activities from students, you are taking away their exercise. When you take away a students exercise you could make them have a risk of death. Also some kids might have a disorder that will keep them away from doing their work, and can only get a c average. And those kids with disorders might love sports or other activities, and you are keeping them away from that. Wouldn't you feel bad knowing you would be taking away something that other people love to do. Also what could happen is that the people that can only get a c average could get mad or jealous at the people with a b average or better. So that would cause a lot of problems in school. There could be more fights then usual. Or people could just stop caring about their grades if they cant get better then a c average trying their hardest. This problem could get you fired because it wouldn't be a good school. So say some kids at your school are having a rough time at home and the only thing that makes them happy is sports. But they only have a c average because of their home life. They wont be happy ever again if they cant do what they love. What happens when a kid that has a b average, gets one bad grade and goes down to a c average in the middle of the season and is the best player? All I'm saying is that it wouldn't be fair to the students if you were to follow through with this policy. Too many kids love sports and have a c average. ",

    "Summer projects are often seen by the student populous as a scourge upon their lives, more work to procrastinate on. To teachers, however, they are a tool which students can use in order to stay on track with their education and keep up-to-date information with. As painful as they seem, these projects are created with a significant goal in mind: teaching accurately and consistently. Although student-designed summer projects are often more in-touch with other students, teacher-designed summer projects are tailored to the expectations of discipline and knowledge held for their students. \n teacher-designed summer curricula enable the student to learn and apply their knowledge suited to the general teaching style. Over the summer, it's difficult for many students to stay on track with their learning, and it's very easy for them to drift away from their usual learning. Staying on-track is essential for students with good expectations and high goals; these projects can be designed to accomplish this, without any rough beginnings once the semester starts. In calculus, my teacher has very high expectations for his students. Every one of us received a \"summertime fun packet\" to work through over the summer, and it prepped us for the year that was to come: the first day of school, he jumped right into action and lectured to us as if it were the day before the AP exam. Because of his summer assignment's intuitive design, most students were prepared for this behavior, and could take thorough notes on the subject, further proving that teacher-designed projects are more useful to the hardworking student. they are tailored to the unique curriculum the student will be taught with. Any good teacher can deviate from the standard curriculum throughout their teaching, and an assignment on par with the syllabus prepares the student for this \"improvisation.\" For instance, my literature teacher assigned us questions analyzing a book we had read in the year, preparing our brains for the material we would be seeing in the year. Although the curriculum calls for practice in rhetorical analysis, it does not discuss proper thesis writing: our instructor assigned us work for both of these. Every dedicated student in the class was not only prepared for the work we were given, but we were confident in our abilities to accomplish these assignments. On account of the deep analysis questions my teacher assigned to me over the summer, I was more able to excel in my work in language and literature, further driving me to learn more and become more accomplished in my English classes. better for the student because a teacher has considerably more years of experience both learning and teaching effectively. Generic_Name taught us to hold mutual respect between student and teacher; in the best of classes, this respect is still exercised and encouraged to make learning as enriching and impactful as possible. With this in mind, the teacher is also more likely to be accurately designing their projects to reasonable expectations for the student, and to make summer assignments as practical as possible. Teachers are constantly informed on new teaching strategies and the most effective ways for students to apply themselves, and it's their job to make use of this in order to prepare their students for their futures. Alongside personal experience and intuitive training, the teacher is in a much less biased position to be creating work, without personal incentives to lighten the workload or to cut corners in their answers. All things considered, the experience a teacher has in preparing students for class is the most valuable quality they hold when it comes to your workload, far outweighing the experience of a busy student. a teacher is undoubtedly the best person to be designing summer projects. The teacher's abilities to tailor their assignments consistent with their teaching style, to prepare the student according to the curriculum they are taught with, and to teach according to their own class experiences enable the most practical and effective work a student can receive. It's very important that summer assignments reflect what a teacher produces in their class. Without this preparation, valuable classtime that could be used to frontload the curriculum is lost, and a student will not get enough out of their education as they require to achieve their highest goals.

    "I am personally against the policy that states that a student has to maintain a B or better average to play a sport or participate in activities. To sustain a C average without playing sports is one thing. But if someone sustains a C average while playing one or more sports is actually quite an undertaking. See I play sports and I have an A average but believe me its not even relatively close to being easy. I believe that other rules having to do with the sports themselves should be altered before there is a change in the grade requirements. If you are going to change something about the sports program change how long the practice can be or the amount of practices allowed per week. That in itself will give the student athletes more breathing room so they will have an easier time bringer their grades up. If these work than you can keep the required average at a C, but if these fail, that is when you would be obliged to make the required average a B so the students have more drive to keep their grades up. But at the time I think you should change the limitations of the sports programs in itself before any of the grade requirements are changed.",
    "I agree with the principal some school work may include working together as a team if they do an activity like sports,they can learn now things like find different ways to score or if they are losing they find ways to comeback. i think its a good idea for students to participate in a extracurricular activity because they can spend time with friends you can join a club that can help you with your homework if you want to play a sport,you can sigh up for a activity that doesnt need to tryout for that sport if you want to get some college credits then you can sigh up for an activity that can help you get some college credit a good way to get some there is multiple ways to get some college credits like a good one is learning a language that is a good way to some college credit. you have nothing to do after school you can join an activity that can keep you busy. And this is why i agree with the principal because it can help us in the further on in life.",
    "I'm against driverless cars and trucks. I'm against driverless cars on the road because everyone woud have to buy the car at the same time or this wouldn't work. This wouldn't work because the first half of people who get the driverless car will be safer. But then the half that doesn't have the smart car will run to the smart car and we are still back to square one. As it says in the story \"sensors are nothing new.\" Sensors are always going to fail there is no way to stop technolgy from failing on point in time. Everything is too new. When one of the parts need replaced on these smart cars its going to cost a fourtne to fix. You already see how with all the technolgy in our cars now its getting to expensive to fix. The problem is the flaw is that they are going to have to keep updating cars and maps in the cars so the car to know the fastest way to the destination. Also if there is unexpected road work it will be try to go right threw the road work and i dont see that working. The next problem i invision is that all the laws will have to be changed to meet the critera of the car. This will in a way force the people who dont want to buy a smart car to have to buy one. As stated in paragraph 9 the car are not reliable enough for the laws to get changed. This is not a safe idea at all because there will always be that one parent that who will program there car to do something for the child and they will expect the car to get to that destination safely. But the risk of a malfunction is very great. The parent doesn't see the risk until it is too late and the child is either hit by another motorist or the car malfunctions and the kid runs into something and the car has gotten wrecked. I also don't feel like it should be the manufacturers fault for the stupidity of the parent.\n if a person wants to stop at some where or at a gas station for a snack or for a restroom break they can't. They can't because the car was only programed to go to that certain place. So in other words you would have to go to the destination then turn right around and go to the gas station or store. As of right now i still think that humans are way more reliable than technolgy. I feel like there will always be accidents. There is no way of stopping people from running in to each other at least once in the cars lifetime. You need alot more research fome me to go along with the idea of having smarter cars. So that is why I think that car should not be smarter yet. ",
    "Last week, I had a math test on my first period. I prepared well for the test, but on that day, I woke up late, and I realized I got late for my school. I also have missed my school bus; therefore, I had to walk the whole way to my school. I was tired and tensed. As a result, I couldn't do well in that test, but if I was taking online class, I could take the test from home and be able to not get into all this trouble Online classes can save us from getting into all this kind of problems and save our time also. Although some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because sometimes, students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class, actually students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities.\n They say sometimes students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class. For example, if they get a project or assignment, some students may have trouble in understanding how to do/complete that assignment or sometimes, they might not understand a topic from a lecture in online class. However, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time. For example, if I get sick, I don't need to miss school. I can stay at home and take my classes from home. Again, if I'm not at home or may be I'm at my relative's place or my friend's place, I'll be still able to attend those classes. Also, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or\u00a0activities. One example is that, if I don't need to come to school to attend classes I would be able to make my own schedule and I can do my job for more hours in weekdays and save money for my college. Again, I can finish my school works quickly and take other courses which can help me in my future career or, may be I can do some other activities I like. In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. Online classes can help us in many ways. Not only it will save our time but also it can give us opportunity to do a lot of extra activities and enjoy the day.",
    "Many students would benefit from attending classes at home. School is a very chaotic place and students suffer from many things on a day to day basis from bullying, interruptions from staff, teachers, and even other students The students would love the idea since they can learn at their own pace be able to focus and get their work done A lot of things can happen to the student if they were to stay in school.\nMajority of students that attend any type of school suffer from anxiety, pressure, and many other things. Having them in a quiet\u00a0area would help them out a lot so they can refrain from any distractions or anything else that can interrupt their school work and make them feel overwhelmed. With the student staying home they will have a better surrounding and environment at home rather than being at school with all of the chaotic things that happen there. One on one time would also benefit the student with a massive impact. Students often get irritated with the fact that teachers would have a line of students asking for questions but their question is far more important. With the student being at home they could get that question answered right then and there without them having to wait minutes for their question be answered. Even questions that are outside of school and the question is urgent, it could help the student out a lot since they may not feel comfortable talking to their parent about it. Parents believe that a student would rather benefit from going to school and doing the work rather than staying at home and doing their classes there. However, there are many possibilities and dangers outside of home that can ruin the students experience going to school and doing their classes there Students staying at home would not only benefit the student but also the parents since the outside world especially school can be a scary place. Having classes at home is a very big step for the schools but it can be done and it would make a huge impact to the students and the parents.\nIf a student did not feel comfortable with the school environment having them be at home in their space, and area it could show a lot of postive results to other parents and students. Students wouldn't have to feel groggy in the morning or be late to any class since they could just be at home and take everything at their own pace with a specific time end date of course. Having classes at home instead of going to school would be a big difference in the world today.\u00a0 ",
    "I believe that driverless cars would be a help to society and the economy I believe so because with driverless cars, everyone will have the same driving skill as everyone else and we won't have people on the road who are either horrible or a professional at driving. Everyone will drive in the same way which will make it easier to avoid other cars and crate less car accidents and collisions. They also use less gas which will stop people from paying for gas so often and will be able to ride their driverless cars much longer without spending as much money on gas. With driverless cars and their sensors, they could possibly be more aware about their surroundings than the average person. When people are driving they have blind spots where they can't see who is around them, with the sensors all around the cars, it will be hard to miss any object coming toward or is near the car from any direction or area. With the car being able to see objects, people who are carless or uncarful or are little kids and don't check to see if cars are coming while crossing the road or getting something in the road, could get hurt if not noticed. All people in a car should be aware about their surroundings when driving, but not all people are. Some girls could be doing their make up or texting. Guys could be texting or just being to careless. They are the ones who would hit an oncoming person or kid in the road and possibly killing someone who is married, young and loved by many people. This would cause them to be arrested and have the guilt of killing someone or potentially killing someone. With the driverless car, if someone wasn't paying attention, the car would make up for it by always being attentive and aware. The cars would either stop or move out of the way to make sure nothing happend to the innocent passerby. Being in a car that does all the work could get a little boring though i'll admit. But, being bored and keeping people safe rather than having fun at the wheel and puting other people in danger is the better way to go. this could also stop people who get disoriented at the wheel as well. Some people either are very sleepy before already driving, get bored while driving and become sleepy, people who are blind and still need a ride, or are even drunk when about to drive. The driveless car can help with these problems as well. It will stop peolpe from going in ditches or hitting other objects. some people are nervous about driving and this could help them alot by not making them drive but still have the ability to go places on their own With all these helpful actions these cars will do for people, I don't see why it could possibly be a bad idea.

    "In the 1960's driverless cars seemed more as like a futuristic fantasy rather than reality, but in todays world, they just might be the next big thing. In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track (Ph. 3). Although this was the first concept of a \"smart car\", the roads would need an unrealistic upgrade that would cost extremely to much. Today however, we have the technology to make real driverless cars. The toll of human error has been evident in the auto-age as more accidents happen every year. The use of driverless cars, or at least almost driverless cars, will be benificial to the future as less accidents will happen, preventing more casualties. \n Today, many cars all across America and the world have road assistance and antilock breaks, but this still gives drivers the oppurtunity to make a mistake and cause an accident. For example, BMW created a system called \" Traffic Jam Assistant\". The car is capable of handling situations at speeds up to 25 mph. This is not bulletproof though, as the human driver still has to be alert when navigating through construction and accidents. Developers though, are getting closer to having real driverless cars. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90% of the time (Ph.10). Technology today makes creations and inventions capable of almost anything. We have had extreneous experience with sensors and radar, two things that are almost required for a driverless car in the upcoming future, to make one. In the 1980's, more than 30 years ago, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes (Ph. 5). With all of the experience gained, we now can make real driverless cars. Infact, we all ready have. Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009 (Ph. 2). Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but roadblocks and problems do lie ahead for a true \"driverless car\". Traffic laws are written with the asssumption that the only safe car has a human driver in contral at all times (Ph. 9). As a result, many states restrict the use of driverless cars on the roads. As driverless cars are a relatively new idea, restrictions will be diminished in due time. Opposers of driverless cars have also made the claim that liability will possibly be the dimise of driverless cars. The discussion of whether or not the human in the seat or the car manufacturer will no doubt be on the minds of lawmakers, but they would quicky come to the conclusion that it would be the driver's fault, since the driver bought the car and knew what he/she was getting into. Manufacturers would also make a liability agreement required in order to driver the car. Although driverless cars will not probably be 100% driverless, the creation of almost driverless cars is not far down in world history. The use of driverless cars, or at least almost driverless, will be beneficial to the future as less accidents will happen, preventing more casualties. ",
    "Developing driverless cars is an important part of the future of the automobile industry. Driverless cars will be safer and more reliable. Self drive cars are the cars of the future because, they can brake, accelerate steer on their own. Driverless cars being able to break and stop on their own would prevent car crashes from happening. This would save lives and prevent injury. The author states \"the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better responce and control than a human driver could manage alone.\" This would allow cars to stop faster than humans could manage and to prevent cars from scidding and flipping. The author reffers to the advancements in the sensors that \"make driving safer\" would allow cars that can handle more tasks on their own. Cars that accelerate on their own would prevent speeding, which is a risky driving habit. If a car is able to accelerate on it's own it would allow trafic to move smothly with little frustration. The author states that \"The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph\". This is a long way from driving on the interstate, however it can be done. The author atates that Sebastion Thrun belives \" That technology has finnaly begun to catch up to the dream\" If technology keeps advancing we could have self driving cars in decades. Cars that can steer on their own would prevent a large portion of car crashes and other automobile accidents. This would save lives, The author states \"but special sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.\" The driver would stil have the ability to have control of the car when neccasary. This way the driving experience is even safer. The author states \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\" This would make the passing of the law to allow self driving cars tricky however it can be done. Self drive cars are the cars of the future because, they can brake, accelerate and steer on their own. This makes them safer and more reliable. This would save lives and prevent injuries which makes them the smart choice for cars in the future, Manufactures should focus on developing self driving cars for the good of the world. ",
    "Many studies have shown that students that suffer from mental illness usually have bad attendance and do bad in school. As technology and social media has advanced throughout the years there has been an increase in online school and home school as an option. Many social media influences as well as athletes also do online or home school to the fact that they are doing other important activities and can still focus on school and graduate Although attending classes from home it might not be for everyone it should still be an option for students Having the option to go to class in the comfort of you're own house or computer can be dependent and benefiting on the lifestyle you have personal preference on learning.\n \nSadly many young adolescents suffer and battle anxiety everyday and gets in the way of their learning. Not just anxiety but many other mental illnesses. For instance,In big schools and highly populated school social anxiety can be hard to cope in the way of you think everyone is looking at you and get really anti social .Speaking from personal experience from someone who is diagnosed with anxiety,my freshman year I had to present in big sized class and I started to get an anxiety attack,I got really red,started shaking,felt nauseous,began stuttering, and felt the whole room closing up. Probably one of the worst experiences ever and to this day whenever I need to present I hope I don't experience that again. Many students deal with this and with anxiety you don't know when its at its peek Having an option to avoid this through being in your home can be benefiting for students and could probably increase grades. Along with mental illness,the lifestyle you live such as being a social media influence or athlete. School is usually 8 hours and usually around two or three hours of homework each day. Social media influencers have a busy life such as promoting brand deals,traveling,collabing with other influencers,and going to brand events. Just like famous athletes need to train almost everyday and be focused by being recruited With doing this at home it can help them worry about what they only need to get done and at their own pace Everyone's life is different and although school is very important we can all agree that having an education is a top priority. You can loose fame any day\u00a0or get injured and loose your skill in a sport but you will never loose your knowledge or education and no one can ever take that away.\n There has been many arguments against\u00a0the way the school system is messed up and how school isn't about learning as much just about passing. Everyone's brain takes in information different, some are kinetic learners or even visual ones. Point is,everyone learns different and at different pace With online school you are in control of your classes and the pace you desire Maybe some days you want to do five hours of school work and then another you only want to do two,its all your own preference and what you feel is your pace. Ultimately ,its how you feel is the best way you learn. Some might argue, with online school that students wouldn't experience the whole\"high school\" experience such as prom,homecoming,football games,making friends,and even social skills. In reality,many schools offer the option of many of this with your zoned school. Luckily ,depending on your situation you can take some classes online and some at school . Throughout the years ,online school has become more popular and easier for many students and helped improve their insights about school. Ultimately being in control of your education can help your grades. Not everyone learns the same and at the same pace. There are many restrictions with this not just in the U.S but globally and many older adults look at it in a bad way,in which it should not be. In conclusion,having the option of attending classes from your own home could be benefiting for the lifestyle they have,mental illness battling, and learning preference.",
    "Luke has a certain point of view on convincing others to participate in this program Luke has this point of view because he thinks the trips were fun on board and he feels it opened up the world to him. It also made him more aware of the other peoples needs in other countries. The awarness stayed with him and thats why he feels this way about other people participating i the program. In the story it states that \"Luke also found time to have fun on board.\"\nI think this helps his point of view because he is convincing others to go on this fun trip.\nThe text also states that these fun activities or games helped them pass time.\nLuke's point of view might of changed by having fun and thats a part of why he is convincing others to participate. \n In the text Luke said \"It opened the world to him.\"\nThe text states that he was grateful for the oppotunity. It also stated that it made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.\nThe passage says that the awareness stayed with him.

    "I would rather prefer policy one, which is that cell phones can be allowed in school and you can use them in lunch time or other free times as long as you do not use them in class. Students think that they can just be cool and use their cell phones in class and hide them behind their books that they are reading. News flash for you kids out there that do that , you can get in a lot of trouble for doing that. you could text some one during a test that has already took that test and ask for the answers or if you are doing a review for a class. By doing that you could get phones took away from school permanently. All because you didn't want to study, so you thought you could text someone and get the answers. If to many people did that then we could get them took away permanently from school and never be able to take them on campus. I do love to text and I am sure that most kids my age do. It is not abnormal to want to text all the time. However whatever you want to send to someone on the phone can wait until after school. Or if you need to tell your parents something or ask them something,\ndo not text them and ask or tell in the middle of class, just go to the office and ask if you can use their phone. I think that we should be able to bring our phones to school,\nbut if we keep texting during class I could completely understand why we couldn't take them to school.",
    "In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", the author is presenting and explaining the new technology that has been made on human an computer communication. In the article he talks about technology that has been created to alter the learning curve in our new generations children The new technology could completely change the way that our new generation learns. By taking a little movement in your face and mathematical putting your face into numbers. \n For example, in paragraph six the author says, \"for example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow\". The author tells how this new face decoder could change your learning path by choosing if you should slow down because your confused, or keep up if you follow with a lesson The author is just supporting the claim that this new technology should belong in a classroom. The author supports bhis claim once again in the first paragraph he says \"she's 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.\" The technology the author has been talking about this whole time just put Leonardo da Vinci's painting Mona LIsa face into one and zeros. If this incredible machine can help our youth than I think everyone should agree on it. The new technology the author talks about is the best helping hand to students. The computer could be the student own personal tutor. This is a revolutionary turn on the eduacation of students. The author also talks about testing the reader in this article by making you make a smiling face in paragraph seven and testing if you felt happier just by making the facial expression. By just tensing up the muscles for an facial expression can actually give the expressions of the facial movement. The article gives plenty of prove to show that the machine could be a benefit to are students the article points are clear and strongly backed behind. The gives every expression that his new technology is good. ",
    "I believe the ''Facial Action Coding System'' is a original idea that nobody has never thought of that till now. Teachers can know now when students are not really interested in a assignment or its boring. '' A class computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.''Teachers need to know when a student is not feeling well. So you now not to push the students buttons. The students point of view is that it will be way more better .''Then it could modify the lesson, like an affective human instructor.' My own opinion is that if we had those ''Facial Action Cody System'' would help alot,so the teachers know when we are not interested in a assignment that they end up giving us.''Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help produce them.''Not even does this idea help you produce feelings like (happy,sad,and disgusted) them in a drama class, but even tells the teachers what you feel also. \n''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking by the look on your face.'' i wish we had this idea at my school but we dont.''of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial that conveys happy,worried,etc..'' I know how i feel when im sad because it is not a good feeling . We know how we feel we just have trouble saying it to teachers or others With this idea we can actually say how we feel without even saying anything. ",
    "The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable One reason why I thik is valuable for a classroom is because it can see if you happy, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Another reason is \" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Lastly, teachers can communicate with their students better and understand them, if she knows the way they are feeling Can this app be spread through all teachers in schools?\n First reason is because it can see if your happy surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This can help students to be more kind to their friends because they know how that person is feeling. It can also help them selfs to realize the way they are feeling because sometimes you don't even know how you feeling. It can help students to change their emotions and feel better about themselfs. Second reason is \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. This can help teacher to know when students need help. It could also help the teacher see if they are bored and make the class a little more fun for students. Teachers can learn more everyday about her students and see her kids have any problems at home or in school. Last reason is teachers can communicate with their students better and understand them, if she knows the way they are feeling The teacher could help the student by giving him space or time alone and not be so hard on him. Teacher could communicate with the student and help them get their feelings out and make them feel better. Teachers might start giving their kids more leassons abou how to feel and how make themselfs get up when ypu feel like the world is against you. Students might start coming to class more happy. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom it can be valuable. For teachers to know students feelings. For teachers to also make the classroom more fun. For teachers to communicate better with students. This could be really helpfull for teacher the most. That's why this could help a classroom with students. ",
    "I heard about your new requirements on community service and students in our school performing community service. I just wanted to give you my opinion on your expectation I think it isn't a very good idea for it to be mandatory to perform community service. It gives less opportunities for students to succeed in their goals, it takes out our free time which gives us time to have fun and learn new things For example, if a student wanted to learn how to play an instrument, they wouldn't be able to learn it because there would be no time for lessons. They would have to be doing community service which would take away the opportunity to learn. They also have many other responsibilities besides community service such as taking care of a younger sibling, focusing on school and education, house chores, and many others. Community service would be another responsibility that a child would have to take on and which maybe not even be prepared for. Students wouldn't be able to have fun and enjoy their lives if they are stuck doing community service. They wouldn't have social time to hang out with their friends. They wouldn't even have time to be with their family as much. Children would be very miserable and would be very depressed at a young age. They wouldn't have to much of a great memory as a child either. Community service isn't a very good thing to make students perform at an early age. It takes away time and opportunities and gives too much responsibility to students. Students should be able to enjoy their childhood and not remember it as cleaning up litter. ",
    "being apart of the voting process is extremely important.It's important,because you are helping by popular vote for the president of the United States.Electoral College helps you get a better understanding of the voting process and the effect that everyone's vote has However,the Electoral colleges are not a really big help when it comes down to the country.Here is provided information about why they should change election by popular vote. First to start the discussion,Electoral Colleges were estblished by the founding fathers in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by popular vote.The Electoral College is not just a place it's an important process.This college is made of electors.They have meetings where they vote for the president and vice president.The college is consisted of 538 electors.At least 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president.Each candidate that is interested in becoming president in your state has to have his or her own flock of electores.The electors are chosen by the political party ran by the candidate This college basically provides you with a idea of why it is important to vote. The country's fate rests in the hands of many. Next,The Electoral college system only allows voters to vote for the slate electors. president of the United States votes is more important then the slate electors.The president of the United States is the one responsible for the Country.Most people refer to the most common argument between the electoral college as the disater factor.Like for instance if someone wanted to vote for a specific person you would have to vote for a different amount of slate electors also depending where you lived as well. \n Continuing,the Electoral college is really regarded as an anachronism aslo known as a non-democratic method of selecting a president. Many people believe that,that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves more popular votes is the winner.Each party selects a slates of electors that is trusted to vote for the nominee that was picked slate electors.Even though the Electoral has a lack of conservative reasons, there are five reasons that people think that should be retained. The first reason is the certainy of outcome,second Everyone's President,third Swing states,fourth Big States,and lastly Avoiding run-off Elections.These 5 things are reasons why people feel that these colleges should stay. The conclusion, the president of the United states is chosen by our votes.We have the power to make this country strong,but we also have the power to make this country a train wreck.Voting is really important this can determine the fate of the country.

    "Should summer projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Most students have to do summer projects for various different classes to ensure that knowledge they collected over the school year isn't lost over the summer. The question is, who should come up with the projects design? I'd say the design of a project would be the topic of the project, the benefit of the project, and the main task that doing the project should accomplish. Students should be the ones choosing the project design because they are the ones completing the project. Students don't want a teacher picking out projects for them to do. Teachers sometimes pick boring things to do thinking that it will teach students lessons. Most kids don't like to focus on things unless they are interested. Kids have a better imagination. I believe a kid would be able to come up with a project that would check all the boxes of a education based project, while still making it interesting and fun. People only learn things when they are actually listening. Kids don't like sitting and listening to something that isn't made interesting. Every topic can be made into an interesting learninig experience, you just have to have the right outlook on it. I believe young people have the right outlook on life and other stuff with a little bit of guidance. the student is the one taking their time out of their summer break to do a project, nobody wants to do that! If the project is teacher-designed and it's boring, the chances are, the kid isn't going to do it The strategy of students designing their own project also teaches structure and organization. It's almost like the student is teaching themselves. Organization and structural skills are needed for a person to be succesful in the real world. I believe most classes should be student based, with a little bit of guidance from the teacher. Students should be more independent and given more trust. The reason most students end up just not doing an assignment is because it's boring. I know for myself it's very hard to bring myself to do something that bores me. Students need to be kept interested or else no learning will come out of the teaching. Interest is a very important part of learning. Hearing a lesson and listening to a lesson are two different things. Teachers aren't trusting enough of students. Students and young people are capable of more things than adults and teachers give them credit for. Students are very capable of coming up with their own project and their own way of learning with a little bit of teacher guidance, to keep everything reasonable and not crazy. Young people have a different outlook on everything that adults. Young people have the ablility to make anything and everything fun. Young people don't get enough credit for that. Adults find kids wanting to have fun all the time irresponsable, but I think it makes everything better and easier. Some people say that teachers should design projects and assignments to keep order and have no chaos in the classroom, but I believe the student should design the projects because it teaches organization and it keeps the student interested. Students have the abiity to entertain themselves and make things fun, and that is why I believe students should design their own summer projects. This should be implemented into classes because I think this strategy would be succesful and beneficial. Students would learn more with this strategy.\u00a0",

    "it helps the community become cleaner makes more people want to join also community service can provide a better place. When people do community service it really shows how much they care about the world. Also when people do work around their community people start to enjoy walking outside and seeing this wonderful place and not no dirty place with garbage everywhere you look Community service is a smart thing to make everyone do in the school This is because if one person can help the community out by just cleaning up some garbage it can only make it better and then maybe more and more people will join them and next thing you know, day by day the community is just getting nicer and nicer. With all this nasty garbage on the ground, please make everyone help out, this place is going to come along to be the best place known to man. And if more and more people join this place is going to look a lot better than it is now. So, make it your choice but think about all the good things that can make this place a lot better. Without community service the community is just going to get worse by the minute, kids are going to be throwing the garbage on the ground, spitting gum onto the new sidewalks, and also many other things that can destroy our community. I think if everyone in the school helps out with the community, this place will end up in your brand new fantasy dream. Also, it can provide a better place because all the dirty candy wrappers, the litters everywhere you walk will be decreasing faster and faster. With the help of everyone in the school, this object can really come out to be an amazing place. In conclusion, i think that you should really take position and make the community service a thing at school, and it will help the community become cleaner, makes more people want to join, and also community service can provide a better place. So with the help of community service this place can turn very new in just a moment of time. Also when people do work around their community people start to enjoy walking outside and seeing this wonderful place and not no dirty place with garbage everywhere you look, and with the help of everyone joining together this place can turn into one of the best places in the world. Can you imagine living in that wonderful, amazing place.",
    "When you ask someone for advice on something do you try to get a second opinion? Well if you have not I bet not getting multiple opinions is not the best choice to make because its smarter to get multiple. Say even if the other opinions are not something you would want or do it is still smart to get because they could help but they wouldn't effect you if they do not help. \u00a0so why not get the second or maybe third opinion on something it will only help. you are getting multiple different people who have different experiences and opinions so you have many to choose from f the first person gave you bad or false info getting a second opinion could help, if you are playing a sport and your getting a doctors opinion on an injury getting a second opinion could keep you playing or help you big.\n getting multiple opinions gives you lots of things to choose from. If you just get one opinion on something then you are only have one thing to go off of but if you have multiple than you can choose which one you think is best. This means a lot because the first opinion might not always be the best one for you. So go and get that second,third or maybe fourth opinion it won't hurt it will only help and you have many different people with different experiences in there life to help you. For example you could ask someone who dose not have much experience in what your asking but then if you get a second opinion they could help you because maybe they have had experience with it sometime in there life. So if you would have just got the one opinion it might not have turned out good as it would if you got that second opinion. So just getting one opinion may not be the best choice. how you could get false or bad information from someone so getting a second opinion could help Well not everyone you ask could have the right information, some could be telling false or just bad information. So getting other opinions could come in big for you if the first opinion was not very good. For example if you are trying to get a opinion on what you should buy a family member for a gift and you only get one opinion and they say that the person likes something but they really don't then that could be pretty bad for you. I don't think you would be to pleased either if that happened so just get a second opinion so everyone can be happy. Also sometimes the opinion could just be really bad and not help you at all. So do your self a favor and get multiple opinions.\n if you play a sport then getting a second opinion is huge especially if it deals with an injury When athletes get injured they get an opinion from the doctor if they think they should get surgery or whatever and most of them go to other doctors for more opinions\u00a0to find there best option. This helps them a lot because some doctors could say they need surgery but then others they go to could say that they won't need surgery and that they just need rest or physical therapy or something. sometimes the doctors will even say they might need career ending surgery but another doctor says that he can still play after a surgery he just need to recover. As you can expect that other opinion helps big time for them so they won't have to possibly end there career. Or it could be the other way around that one doctor says he dose not need surgery but other doctors do then he should go with surgery so whatever is hurting does not get worse and force him to stop playing. For example a couple of weeks ago there was this pitcher in baseball that got injured and was going to doctors to see if he was okay one doctor said he would need Tommy John surgery which usually puts you out for a whole season and he didn't want that so he went to two other doctors who both said he wouldn't need it so that saved him from missing a entire season which helps him a lot. Now\nI will conclude my reasons on why people should seek multiple opinions to help them later on. So as you can tell after reading this finding more opinions is very helpful and could change your life in some ways. However this does not mean that every first opinion you get is wrong it just means that it dose not hurt to have\u00a0multiple opinions to choose from. Like I said in sports and In basically anything in life it helps because you will always have choices to make and getting more opinions might just come up big for you. After going over my essay of why you should get multiple opinions then I hope you consider seeking more than one opinion next time you need an opinion on something. \u00a0 ",
    "Should there be a rule on everyone taking extracurricular\u00a0activities. Yes because they provide information and fun for the students. Without after school activities students wouldn't of made as many friends as they have made. When I was in an extracurricular class we got to know the teacher better and see what she had to teach us. I met one of my friends today at an extracurricular activity because\u00a0we had the same interest in soccer. I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricular\u00a0activity they can meet new students be active learn more about a subject. Extracurricular activities educate students about a specific topic that the students are interested in For example, I was in the soccer club in 6th grade and we learned about the history of the sport and how it started. The robotics club is where students learn about building and technology. It can help students learn tips and tricks about architecture and how to build things. That can help them in the long run if they want to join a field that uses robotic and architecture. It also teaches students how to work with others to solve a problem. Extracurricular activities serve as good learning chances for students. By taking extracurricular classes students get to meet new students and make friends. The students have common interest so they can talk to others and make friends. An extracurricular activity would be good for a shy student so they can get out of their comfort zone in a small group of people. Students can learn to share their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a small group and them they can get more comfortable to do it normal school. These friends can transfer over to normal school so kids that are quiet and don't have any friends will have someone to talk to, someone to work with during group work and, a friend. Extracurricular activities can help students make friends and come out of their comfort zone. Being active is an important part of daily life. Extracurricular activities can help students be more active. They give students something to do after school other than homework and sports. Students can catch up with their friends they haven't seen all day and give their parents a break. Extracurricular activities are good for teachers if they are bored and want to teach and have fun with their students. Extracurricular activities also count as the sports teams so you can be active by joining a sports team. For example, I joined the soccer club so i could be active. It was really fun and a good way to be active. Extracurricular activities are a good way to be healthy and active.\n Extracurricular activities gives lots of opportunities to students. They should make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities have lots to give to the students. They should be mandatory for them so they can learn more and expand their view of learning. Extracurricular activities helps kids come out of their comfort zone and make friends. Extracurricular activities help students make friends, learn about a specific subject, and stay active.",
    "I think kids should not have to do community service I think kids that have committed a crime should be forced to do community service. Also i think that if a kid volunteers to do community service then they can, i do not think a kid should just be told to go pick up all the trash around the city for no apparent reason. it will teach them not to do whatever it is that they did again. The child should be given a task and a certain amount of hours to do this said task. I also think that if you volunteer for community service that should be aloud. An example of this is if there was graffiti on a wall in the city i think a group of kids can volunteer and paint the wall and cover the graffiti. Another opinion i have is that you should not force the kids. What if they have things to do such as sports or other activities. Also it takes to much time for kids they want to do other things not read to children younger kids all day. I think my opinions seem fair enough and better than forcing the children.",
    "Freedom to vote for authority figures in America had been an ideal image of government all across the world. However, is our priviledge to vote really honest and are the results of elections really in our hands like we think they are? The Electoral College System undoubtedly should be abolished because Americans have the right to have full control over who is elected President although some may believe that Electoral Colleges avoid the occurance of a run-off election, run-off elections may be avoided with much more reasonable methods. Clearly, election should be determined by popular vote, and not the Electoral College because Americans earned their right to have full control over the representatives in their government According to Source 2, \"state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selelction of people to make the final decision of millions (Source 1). The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to illude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions? In Source 3, Posner states that when there is an unclear plurality in the results of an election, the Electoral College makes it much simpler and more efficient by reducing the number of voters, eliminating the inconvenience factor. This statement appears as a faulty reasoning to have an Electoral College because it is obsurd to remove Americans' right to vote Maybe, rather than restricting our rights, the result of a run-off election could be resolved by an Electoral College, but the initial vote should be made only by the citizens, fairly. Depending on the defenders to make the final decision of the leaders of our great country is an overly-cautious effort to avoid a tie, which could be easily resolved. You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutional-right to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcome(Plumer 13, 14). Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider.",
    "Do you feel like you are constantly racing around life? I am. I practically live somewhere between my car and high school. My days are spent racing from one place to another or from one activity to another. Good bad or indifferent, I am home to sleep and re-charge in the evenings and weekends. If I didn't have a cell phone to use in my car, you might not hear from me for days. My phone is currently my co-pilot in life.\nSad but probably true. I am a supporter of cell phone usage while in the car.\n The ability to use a cell phone is necessary in these times It is a on the go kind of world. My teachers email me. I keep up with my grades. I get emails. I can check the weather. I can keep up with my friends. My phone serves as my personal trainer. I can check my bank account. In the event of an emergency, having a cell phone that can allow me to seek help, report problems and potentially save lives. The importance of a cell phone goes way beyond the option to make or receive phone calls. According to Google, in 1973 the first cell phone was portable so it could travel with you. This is a game changer. I can keep up with family and friends with the capability to use my phone on the go. Guess what? They keep up with me too. We are so busy we don't even have a home phone. With the capabilities of a cell phone, we can run our lives from where ever we are. My cell phone serves as my one stop shop. It is always having everything I need with me. With the advances in technology we are now able to pair our phones with our cars either by aux or blue tooth. This is genius. We don't even have to worry about holding our phone. In addition, it is hands free and voice activated. I am a law-abiding citizen and I always sync my phone after I fasten my seat belt. I type in my first location to my next to avoid traffic and crashes.\n With safe phone usage, cell phones should be allowed in your car. My phone serves as my safety device and my directions. I can find gas stations easily or change my driving due to traffic. My mom can keep up with me, unless I turn off my location.",
    "Do you think this \"face\" was created by aliens? I think not because this \"face\" was not created by aliens but created by a natural landform Landforms happen all the time, just because it happend on another planet doesn't mean aliens did it. In the article NASA unveiled the picture for all to see and THEY captioned it \"huge rock formation\" Which basicly means even NASA doen't think it was aliens who created it. Also after the articles states what NASA captioned the picture, it says \"formed by shadows giving the ALLUSION of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Its just an allusion not even a face really. Also, the aticle says \"there was no alien monument arter all. if NASA really believed aliens did that I don't think NASA would release it to the world. I'm sure the government is strict on them on releasing things to the public. NASA probably wanted people to pay attention to them so they can have their one minute fame. Skeptics think alien marking were hidden by haze. Come on really, all the great technology NASA has and you think it was hidden behind clouds. \nThe technology they have is great. When they finally got a clear shot to take a picture, they took it After they took it, they zoomed in three times bigger... nothing. NASA said if there were any small shacks or evidence of aircraft you would have seen what they were. Marvin, from NASA says it reminded him of landforms created on Earth, so if an expert that works at NASA\nthinks that it was created by a landform, then why do we think it was an alien or aliens that created it? In conclusion, the \"face\" was not created by an aliens or aliens, but was just created by a landform. ",
    "I think that all students should be required to do community service. Community service has always just been an option, but I think we should take that one step further, and tell students to get out there and help. I think it will not only benefit others, but it will also effect the person that is helping in a positive way.\n One reason for me saying that community service should no longer be just an option, but a task that needs to be fulfilled, is because it is a great way of getting out into the world and in a way, experience new things. Not everyone can say that they have their next meal planned out in there head. Its just a fact that some people don't have that luxury. In some cases, people have to get their meals from a soup kitchen or other similar locations. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad thing, but sometimes the people want change, which includes the people that serve them. I think it is the least we could do to volunteer at on of these soup kitchens and just take time to get to know some new people. This is a task that will not take that long, and I'm almost positive it would make someone's day better, which will more than likely make you feel good. If soup kitchens aren't for you, and you don't want to take the time to drive there or whatever the excuse is, then start out smaller. Something as little as tutoring a younger student or even babysitting is still just as beneficial as lets say going to a soup kitchen or helping out at a retirement home. It's just another way of simply helping someone out, and it wouldn't take that long to do it. It will effect you and the person that you are helping in a positive manner. So as you can see, I strongly believe that everyone should do a community service once in a while, and that it should be a requirement. It doesn't have to be something big, and it will help someone out, whether its one person, or the whole bunch. Even if community service isn't on the top of your list of favorite things to do, you should still get out there and help!",
    "After reviewing information about the Electoral College, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used in deciding or electing the president of the United States. \"Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President.\" The sitation before states that it is not the President the voters are voting for, it is actually the electors that the people are voting for, who in turn will vote for the President. This situation does not allow for the people to directly vote for who they believe will be the best President. It is really in the hands of the electors who will become President. Secondly, after realizing that the number of electoral votes decides if you beome President or not, the Presidential candidates are going to want to focus on obtaining the most votes as possible. After determining which states they \"have in the bag\", the candidates are going to put their campaigning efforts toward the \"toss-up\" or \"swing states\". Here they will have to compete in a tight race between the other party to sway the voters of the state to vote their way. This method of campaigning in the swing states doesn't allow for much campaining in the big, numerous votes states. An example of this would be that during the 2000 campaign, almost 20 states did not see the candidates at all as well as campaign ads. With the Electoral College system in place, Presidential candidates are focusing more on obatianing the \"swing state\" votes and not so much on supporting and visiting the states and people they know they have.\n Finally, the system of electing electors who then vote for the President can be considered unpredictable. This being because the electors could at any time defy the will of the people. These shady electors, also known as \"faithless electors\", can deny to vote for their party's candidate and instead cast the vote for whomever they desire. This shows that it is not the people's choice, instead the choice of the elector. Also, the state legislatures are responsible for choosing the electors. This could cause an issue where the state legislatures are choosing electors who will vote for their party. Let's take it back to the 1960's where an example of this corruption almost took place. Segrigationists, or people who favored racial seperation, who were state legislatures in the state of Louisiana nearly suceeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. This would've caused the popular vote to go to Kennedy's opponent. For the many reasons listed above, the Electoral College could be considered unpredictable and in some cases... shady. Overall Mr. Senator, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used to determine who becomes the President of the United States instead they should use popular vote. This being because the people are not directly voting, the candidates are just focusing on getting the votes and not on the people. And lastly because it can be considered unpredictable with the \"faithless electors\" and bais state legislatures.",
    "Have you ever asked your friends for advice on an issue or to help solve a problem? If so, did you take that advice, or throw it to the wind without ever looking back? seeking multiple opinions allows for better decisions to be made. it allows us to view an issue from multiple angles, allows for a more unbiased response, hearing several opinions can change our thinking on a certain subject for the better. Hearing several sides of a story or particular topic, can often have an affect on our decisions. Say you and a friend get involved in an argument and you aren't sure how to handle it. You ask some friends what to do. They explain that your friend is having a bad day and some family issues at home. Rather than be upset with your friend, you decide to do everything in your power to help your friend out. Hearing other angles or sides of a story changes the way we view an issue or person, therefore plays a key role in the making of that decision or series of decisions. say a woman and her boyfriend have a disagreement. Asking her boyfriends best friend may not be such a great idea, seeing as he could be biased on the subject. Asking a group of neutral friends would prove most effective, therefore less biased. In more cases than none, one particular person may favor one side more than another, where as multiple people could appeal to both sides. \n An example would be, a friend of yours pulls a ruthless prank on you. Instead of laughing along with your friend, you become upset and infuriated. You make a split second decision to retaliate. Several people encourage you to inform your friend that their actions bothered you, rather than getting even. Hearing the same thing from several people can often affect the way we view a topic. Rather than repeating those infuriating actions towards your friend, you explain to that individual that you were offended and deeply upset by their prank. When we decide in our minds that something negative is a good idea, or our only option, hearing differently from multiple people with our best interest at heart becomes a deciding factor in the choices we make daily. asking multiple people for advice is more efficient that asking only one. Hearing several opinions allows for neutral, unbiased advice. Receiving advice from several friends, teachers, peers, or family members can play a rather important role on our thought process on a given topic in a positive way. And viewing all sides of a story, instead of just our own, can allow for better, more beneficial choices to be made. ",

Driving can be very dangerous especially when using a cell phone.\n Using a cell phone while driving is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing drivers to become distracted and get into accidents. Car accidents happen every day, 16 percent of those accidents are related to cell phones. That's more than the percentage of accidents caused by bad weather. Not only have cell phones been known to distract drivers from driving but all distract people from walking, working, and homework. Many laws in the United States regulates the use of a mobile phone while driving. Recently a new law came into effect on July 1 stating that using a cellphone while driving will be illegal in Georgia. In Florida texting and driving become prohibited at midnight. Florida is a lot more lenient than Georgia about texting and driving but facts are facts. Driving while on the phone can become hazardous. Teen drivers are most likely to be on their phones while driving, which can be a gamble with their life and the lives of other drivers.

    "We all are sometimes going to need advice from people. We aren't always going to make good choices but getting advice will help in the future. help you know how to make better choices. help with making a better choice effect on what you choose to do. I can relate to think because I ask my parents for advice about things all the time. They tell me how i can make the situation better and how i can prevent it from happening again. An example is if you get in a fight with a sibling, you can walk away and just go straight\u00a0to your parents instead of hitting them back or whatever they do to you. I can relate to this because when something happens i think about what my parents say and I know that if i use their advice it will make the situation better. An example is you got into an argument about something and you dont want to make the situation worse. So you think about what the person you asked for advice said and use it for the situation you are in. If you use their advice you probably wont get into any fights or arguments as much and won\"t have to worry about getting into as much or no trouble. I can relate to this because if i get into a fight with my sibling. I think about what my parents would say if i did anything and how much trouble i would get my self into. An example is when someone is talking bad about you. You would think about what would happen if you fight them and what your parent advice was when you told them about it. would you still go after them even if you talked to your parents about it and got their advice.

    "Seeking multiple opinions when making a difficult choice can be beneficial the decision maker will see many perspectives, Others may have more experience than the decision maker, asking more than one person will help to eliminate any false or non-beneficial advice. When faced with any decision one will always have a specific opinion or view of the topic at hand. For some it is hard to move past their beliefs\u00a0and see the other side of the story. For example, If a person refuses to see other perspectives, their stubbornness could lead to the wrong decision and a path that that could have been avoided if they had been more open-minded.\u00a0Talking to multiple people and being open-minded can help one see many different perspectives and can sway them to one side or the other. After seeing all the sides to the story it will be much easier to make that important decision, so when faced with a difficult decision always look to many people to make the right choice.\n other people may have more experience If one were to only receive advice from a single person the chances\u00a0of that person having the right experience to give good advice are low. For example , Generic_Name's car needs an oil change. Generic_Name asks all of his friends if they know any good mechanics. One of Generic_Name's friends happened to know the best mechanic in the area. Asking lots of people until he found the best advice from the most experienced person helped Generic_Name make the best choice. This same strategy can be applied to a number of different stuations much more important than an oil change. talking to multiple people can help eliminate non-beneficial advice. Advice that is not beneficial or even harmful to ones decision making process could be given out by accident by a less experienced\u00a0individual. Just like how some people hove lots of experience some have little. This problem can be avoided by simply talking to more people because non-beneficial advice will stand out in contrast to the more rational and well thought out advice. A strategy that will help to lessen the amount of harmful advice is to seek out advice from people that are known to have more experience. This way the majority of feedback that is received will be very beneficial, making unwanted advice that much more distinguishable.\n In conclusion, When searching for advice talk to lots of people and consider their opinions while keeping an open mind. Also, Talk to lots of people to find the individuals that have the most experience and can give the very best advice. once again, Talk to lots of people in order to identify the advice that could lead one to make the wrong decision. Finally, seeking out the opinions of not one person but many will lead to making the right decision in all of the tough situations that life brings.",

    "In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", the author is describing a new technology, one that enables computers to identify human emotions This could be valuable in the classroom for both a student and a teacher Many teachers can find a hard time to deal with students because of things that could be going on at home. Teachers can find it hard to also help students if they don't know how they are feeling. Facial Action Coding system can help those teachers understand what a student is feeling. For example, Sarah has a lot of family issues going on at home. She comes to school, doesn't feel like doing her work and her teacher want's to help her but doesn't know how to approach her. This technology can help the teacher get a better understanding on what Sarah is feeling and even ask her why she feels that certain emotion. This can build up a good relationship between a student and a teacher. A lot of students don't have good relationships with teachers because some teachers could say the wrong thing which leads to the student not wanting to say anything.\n In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states that \"A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored\", this also could a help a teacher to know what type of assignments or projects that she/he could give to the class so the students wouldnt be bored or confused This could also give insight to the teacher on what she/he feels like they should do better in there lectures or what their teaching to the class. In my personal expierence, I knew a lot of teachers who didn't know how to approach me because they either didn't know what to say or how to say the right thing. If my teachers had this type of technology built into the school computers and could see through their computer how student's and myself were feeling. I would have a much better relationship with most of my teachers because they would have known what I'm feeling, whether i'm feeling sad or angry.\n In my conclusion, the Facial Acting Coding System would be valuable of students in a classroom because it could both help students and a teacher to be able to build a strong, trusting relationship and also giving insight to one another. This could help thousands of teachers worldwide on how they could help there students and also have a understanding on what they could change or learn in their classroom from a students facial expression.

    "Driverless cars could be the future of our generation. Many car companies have taken this idea and are trying to pursue it. They are cars that, eventually, will drive by themselves. It seems like a very creative and speechless innovation. However, there are many questionable aspects of the car that need to be taken into account. I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations. Drivers today have to go through intensive studying and classes just to gain a license. They think of it as the first step into adulthood and freedom. If driverless cars do take over our population, that will disapear. Teens will look past the greatness of being able to drive, and will look for another way to gain the freedom that they are desperatley seeking for. They also will not have anything that they are in complete control of. In the article it says, \"He envisions a future with a public-transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system.\" If this happens, teens would not be in conrol of the car, the car would. That leaves kids to rely on yet another thing in their lives. Teens already have to rely on many things everyday. I think that if we add another one, and take away that sense of freedom, we will be taking away a big part of life. This is one reason I do not think driverless cars are a good idea. Another reason I disagree with them is because of safety Technology should not be relied on for big tasks like driving. Car companies are being thourough and making sure they are safe, but technology, even today, still seems to occasionally mess up. In the article it says, \"Most drvining laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.\" I agree that the best way to ensure safety is with a driver that is focused and knowledged. These driverless cars could potentially be dangerous to us. If the car messes up even once, or the company makes a mistake in the programming, we could definately be in great danger. Safety is the most important thing, and because we can never be 100% sure that technology won't mess up, we should not have driverless cars in the future. The final reason I do not think that we should be excited for driverless cars is because of the law . If a regular car gets into an accident, we have laws that say who should be at fault. Also, it can already be complicated to figure out who should take the blame today with regular cars. If we all drove driverles cars, a new stack of laws would have to be made to support them. Getting used to those laws would be hard because we have never lived in the world of driverless cars. In the article it says, \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?\" This is a good point. If there is an accident where someone gets injured, not everyone will agree who should take the fall for it. There will be riots and fighting between manufacturers and individuals, and overall, it is not worth it. We should not destroy what we already have for something this risky. These are the reasons that I do not think driverless cars should be pursued by car companies. I do agree that they would be very cool, but they are in fact, to good to be true. With the many complications that could come up, to the lack of freedom in teens, driverless cars take away more than what they could be bringing. Instead of investing in this innovation, we should use the investments to pursue more practical products, and to continue to make what we already have, better. Driving comes with a great responsibility that technology does not have. That is why I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations. ",

    "For many years people have been using cars to get around to do their important tasks.\u00a0 The stress every indivdual has to go through just to make it through the day could be difficult. It is better if we create a car free world. Just picture you waking up in the morning peacefully without the sounds of car motors turning on or the smell of smoke in the air. With the reduction of cars, the planet would be a healthier and safer place to live on. Limiting car usage can have a numerous amount of advantages to citizens With all the issues every country has, the most important one is the emisson of green house gases. With the use of less cars, the green house gas percentage rate will go down significantly. Another advantage ciztens have to limiting car usage is that it lowers the cost of indivdual of paying their car bills and the amount of gas which is really high. With other types transportation like public buses, walking or riding a bicycle this effort helps to conserve resources that are about to disappear since we use them too much it improves our safety with the reduction of having car accidents due to traffic jams. In source 1 Vauban, Germany their is a community that has 5,500 resident that do not own a car. This community restricts car into their streets. This communtiy is a \"low-car suburban life\" that has a wallkway,stores on the main street and some distant highways with the help of public transportation. As we continue our effort into establishing a \"car free\" community it will benefit us in the future. While we reduced the percentage of green house gases in the air then the government will not have to worry about one problem and move to something that needs to be fixed right away. All the taxes we've have beeen paying will to crisis outside of our country. If we expand these no car communties that Colombia and Germany have then there will be a \"shift in American behavior\" source 4 states. Americans love cars but as the years passed by from \"2005-2013 the miles driven per persons have slowly decereased 9 percent.\" Hopefully,as the next few year it will make a difference. Even though us humans love cars their is a limit into how much we should use them. But as we grow we will have a healthier and dafer planet to live on, spend less moeny on cars and more money on important nessesites, and it woyukd create a better future for our children an their families. \u00a0\u00a0",
    "Should the electoral college process be demolished? Many would say no way PROPER_NAME, but I strongly consider the electoral college process should be demolished I believe this because I think the citizens of the U.S. should be able to vote for their favored presidential candidate directly voters are not really voting for their presidential candidate, they are voting for a slate of voters. First off, let's get something straight, citizens who regularly vote in the presidential election are not really voting for their desired presidential candidate. All fifty of the U.S. states are given a certain amount of electoral votes. As the electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, it's not fit for the present anymore. According to the third source,\nthe electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaing that the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winn\ner. There are five reasons why the electoral college has not been demolished yet,\nCertainty of outcome\nEveryone's President\nSwing States\nBig States\nAvoid Run-Off Elections these are the reasons ehy the electoral college has not been demolished even though it is highly resented in the U.S.A. In continuation, people who vote should be able to directly vote for who they are in favor of winnning the presidency. That basically means whoever's name was checked off on their voting card should have been their pick to win the election, not for another sllate of voters who do the voting for them, that's not having a voice. The electoral college method of selecting the president may turn of potential voters for a candidatr who has no hope of carrying their state. For example, Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect. In closing, I urge that the electoral college process should be outruled. Because people who don't support their state, their vote won't matter until this electoral college process is outruled. It is important that all Americans vote count in a election of any kind. They should be able to vote for whoever they want directly, not for electoral, but for the popular vote. Not to vote for a slate of voters who elect the president themselves. Now, again, should the electoral college process really be demolished? ",
    "When people need advice they ask people you have to see what their opinion is and then you think of what it is,opinions don't matter all it matters is what you think it don't ever let someone opinion change your whole mindset because it could get you in trouble ,so make sure your are getting the right advice don't do something dangerous and think about the right thing to do maybe you will be suprised with a gift or something special when you get good advice just take it don't listen to everyone you see because it might end up backfiring on you in the long run.\n Advice could come come in anyway or shape such as lessons,games,work,sports,internet,habitat,style, and etc all it matters is that you know what your doing. Secrets and stories are also forms of advice because someone is telling you what happened in their life and how you can avoid it so it won't happen to you so when was someone is trying to tell you something important always listen it would probably keep you safe and out of trouble so if something goes down you were not involved in it so no one can blame you for something that you never did or was not even a part of, Opinions are like emotions because i could say that lil wayne is trash in my opinion but others will disagree but if it your opinion keep it because it is people who get mad over opinions for no reason and it makes no,don't ever change your perspective of something no matter what they it is your emotions to like and don't like don't anyone tell you otherwise you could do the wrong i use to think wrestling was real until i realized that it was scripted (fake) but even if people told me it was fake i did not care i have been watching wrestling for years and in my opinion i love wrestling becausse i see guys wrisking their live for your entertainment ,i also watch movies,tv ,sports,anime,cartoons ,and etc and i like them all. When your taking advice or opinions make sure you know what they are saying to you so you won't be confused when your thinking about it ,when i get advice i use it to help me against problems so it won't escalate further because you never know what people are thinking that is why keep my distance i don't have time for that it is pointless it's arguing with a 3rd grader all they do is talk and i also learned that when it comes to my mom everyone will talk about her even though i really don't like it i have to deal with it which i have a counselor to help me control my anger before i lose it and explode because it is just some stuff in life that makes you hurt people because you have no other choice but there is always a choice everyone in the world has chocies that could either hurt you or heal you which is why if im about to do something crazy i go calm down so i won't end up the wrong thing that could cost me in the long run so i always take advice from my older sibilngs and opinions to me are just your feelings for sommethinng you love or hate that is something you keep with you. In my image opinions and advice are way different advice is for lessons and thinking while opinions is just your aspect of a person,place,and a thing because taking advice may help anyone who is not in the right mindset and it maybe will help you think otherwise about your all i care about is succeding in life that is my goal my name Generic_Name and i approve this prompt.",

    "Have you ever needed someones opnion about something but didnt know who to ask? Do you not know if you should ask your parents, teachers, or friends? Most of the time people only ask one or two people, but thoes spific people might not always be able to give you the best advice. When makeing a choice it is better to ask mutipule people for their opinion rather then just asking one person.\n Whenever you are trying something new wither that be a new food or if you should on vacation to a place you've never been before you should always ask multipule peoples opions. For instnce, if you cant decide wither or not to join the school soccer team and you only ask one person who is on the team they will tell you that you should join. However if you ask someone who is not on team they will probley tell you difrently So if you ask for multiple people for their opinion you are doing they best thing you can do for yourself. When you ask multipule people their opinon they will most likely all have diffrent advice for you baced on their past experiences. For example, when I was going to californa I asked all my friends who have been there befoere where I should eat. Most of my friends told me their favorite restarants there, but one of my friends told me not to go to this one little beach hut restorant where they serve fresh sea food. She told me not to go their because when she went there with her whole family they all got food poisning and had to cut their vacaison short. I was very greatful for that advice because if my family had gone their and gotten sick and had to go home early I would have been very upset.\n if you ever need someones opinon on something it is better to ask multiple people rether then one person so that way you will get the best advice. That way you can learn from peoples mistakes and not make the same ones. You can also find out what the best opsion is for you in any situation.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

We kids need time to express our selves in sports learn to get better at it and keep on trying to achieve our goals in life. By not letting kids play sports they will change school to a school that lets them play sports with a c average. Parents will argue cause their kid can't play the sport that he or she want to play cause they have a c average I think that kids with a c average or higher could be able to play sports but kids with d or f averages should have to get their grades up and get help if they need help. When you change the rules kids wont go to this school or their parents will argue with you about the rule change. This is why you shouldn't change the rules at our school to a student need to have a b average or higher to play sports. ",
    "After reading the passage I came to the conclusion that some ways I think it's not valueble FACS would be a smart tool for case workers or counslers Some case workers deal with people who have emotion diseases such as post dramaic stress diseases in that nature . I feel like the creator could've made the tool for more serious reason, not that the emotion FACS was pointless but who would want to just find out their emotion and they can already feel it or going through it. I feel like people would want to find out things more important like , whats going with that person , is the person feeling sick , is the person healthy . FACS could been about how's the day going to go , whats the weather going to be like I feel like FACS is all hype in some way because it's basic They took all this time and objects figure how someones doing or feelings , instead of how we're living . Anyone can figure out someone's emotion expresses by their body language , their tone , how their speaking , when their speaking and etc. Often people may not want to speak on how they feel , alot of times teens want to keep their problems and emotions to them selves Students are diffrent from adults, and also handle emotions diffrently. FACS would be valueble if they come with conclusions to that person emotion at the time , plenty of ways technology can do things. If the FACS were a solution to a person with a bad day it would be valueble. Due to the fact their making this like it's a cool invention when FACS is exposing peoples feelings and then wat after that? I feel like the FACS should be upgraded and do more with it . ",
    "Should drivers be able to use their phones while driving?\nIn 2017 3,166 people were killed by distracting driving. In 2017, there were 34,247 distracted driving accidents, so let's be realistic is your phone that important to be risking your life?\nPhones in our generation are a popular matter, us teens even adults get carried away from what we are intended to do because of the distraction of cellular devices.\n40% of teens say that they have been in a car when the driver used a cell phone. There's a saying U DRIVE. U TEXT. U PAY. Distracted driving is dangerous so many lives have been taken just by one simple text back . Using a cell phone while driving creates deaths and injuries on U.S. roads. In 2017 alone, people were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers. \"Distracted driving is any activity that diverts attention from driving, including talking or texting on your phone, eating and drinking, talking to people in your vehicle, fiddling with the stereo, entertainment or navigation system-anything that takes your attention away from the task of safe driving\". Every year in the U.S., almost a half million people are injured or killed in traffic accidents to the combination of texting and driving. The statistics are shocking, especially in view of the fact that this danger could be completely avoided more than 3,000 teens die each year in crashes caused by texting while driving. \"High school students who reported frequent texting while driving was less likely to wear a seat belt, more likely to ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and more likely to drink and drive\". Cell phones are involved in 1.6 million auto crashes each year that cause a half million injuries and take 6,000 lives.\" According to research conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks.\" Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces brain by 37 percent. In 2015, 42 percent of high school students who drove in the past 30 days reported sending a text or email while driving. In conclusion, being in a rush to pick up a phone while driving isn't the route to go. Too many love ones have lost their life for a quick second to check that \"one message\" don't be the next victim, there's a time and a place for everything.",
    "I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to go places you probably have never been to, and explore them in your free time. You get to see countries that might feel special to you. You get to help countries recover food supplies, animals, and more because of wars. You have to take care of the animals by feeding and giving them water two or three times a day. Also, you have to clean stalls, move hay bales and bags of oats. I once served as a night watchman, and you may think that it is boring, but you get to check on the animals a few times to see if they are alright. You sometimes can risk yourself working the nightwatch in the rain because I slid down a ladder, and cracked my ribs It is still a fun job because you have a lot of free time, and you can play volleyball and baseball games. To pass the time from returning the trips after the animals had been unloaded, they would have table-tennis tournaments, boxing, reading, fencing, games, and whittling. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an adventure, but also teaches you that other countries and their needs. My family helped people by hosting a number of exchange visitors, and a number of international students You should be a Seagoing Cowboy because it's hard work, but it pays off on the beautiful sights you will see.

    "Why would you want to limit car usage. When you use your car people are making money. People need a car to far away places fast. cars are expensive, thats because people keep adding on to it and making it more fancy and of corse its going to be more expencive.\nIf you limit cars most gas stations would be going out of bussniess and car places. gas stations buy the gas for cars to use yeah the gas is expensive but we need it and car dealerships would have so many cars they wouldnt know what to do with them cause no one would but them because there car would be limited to use so there car would be brand new. yes people are losseing alot of money from cars but its worth it cause we need to get places. if you make cars fancy yeah your going to have people to want to buy it but thats because you want them to buy it cars are killing the envirnment up though because the gas the people tearing into there grass people dont relize it but cars should just be used to get places and then stay there and then when there done go home. i mean if they can make a car that can scene if there drunk and wont start i would buy that car because it would tell you not to drive becaus eyou are drunk that will slove so many deaths and drunk driver accident problems. instead of making cars fast and look slicker and nicer and have the car talk to you with blootooth thats just dumb in my opion i wish they would just make cars more reasonable with things that really matter than just look nicer and more for rich people alot of people can afford cars so they should lower all prices and they would make more money becaus emore stuff will be sold like the drunk deceter car\u00a0 ",
    "Have you ever felt like you could not handle school?, well let me tell you that you have options, in here you are going to know the benefits of being home school. When I was younger school was a challenge for me; There was always\u00a0conflicts at school and the environment was really a distraction, not good for me. Attending to school from hone have a lot of benefits. Students are going to be more focus in their studies and they are going to understand the meaning of responsibility.\n One of the reason why home school it's good for students is going to be that students are going to be more concentrate and focus on their studies. Students manage to work better if they are alone, since they do not have any distraction\u00a0around them like: drama, bad influences, mean teachers, stress and so much more. This is really good for those students who want to get their stuff done and learn more efficiency. So attending to school from home is one good option for those who want to focus on their studies. Responsibility is one of the most important skill that us like humans have to have. Being responsible is a hard skill to follow but it is the most important one since we use it on the daily bases. If students attend to be on home school they have to learn that is not easy and they have to be really responsible because they are not going to have a physical teacher in front telling them what to do. Therefore you have to get it by their on hands and learn the meaning of being a mature and a responsible person. Students are going to be more responsible because if thy have any project, homework or test they are going to manage the way to study and do their stuff by them self and using the tools of their online program. I understand that some people may disagree and prefer students to go to a normal school since they are going to have more social life. Having social life it's really important but who said that being in home school means that they are not going to have any social life, it's the opposite because if students are all caught up with their things they are going to have so much time to hang out with friends and family.\n In conclusion the benefits of being home school are really good since students are going to focus on their own things and studies also they are going to learn how important it's to be responsible. now days we use technology for everything because it let us have a lot of more options if people is struggling with school. so more schools should include some online programs for students who want to continue their studies from home. This is going to bring a big change in our community and more professional, responsible people.\u00a0",
    "Many people believe that \" the Face\" on Mars is actually a alien of some sort or a human. I can truly convince you why it's not a alien, it's only a landform. I can see why people can believe its an actual face because it has the qualities of a face: eyes, mouth, and nose. Here are my reasons why this is definetly a landform. First, there is no evidence of anyone going to Mars. \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" Mars has a very harsh climate and no one would even dare go off to a terrible, deserted planet to just not come back. Secondly, there is no history of anything in space involving aliens and their artifacts. Many would say that the aliens didn't want us to knw they exist but the article states it could have been a person going to Mars. Scientists would have contacted the world and said we have evidence or living organisms on Mars. Yet many people would believe living organisms on Mars and I can agree with that if they have fantastic reasoning to their theory. They might say that if someone went to Mars they coud have not brought back anything or they got stranded on Mars and that could have been their body. People may believe that anyone on Mars would not survive the deserted planet with harsh climate and they would surely die there. Some sort of creature may have made it and they would give us evidencce of life on Mars. You never really know if there may be some sort of living organim on Mars unless you study it closer. Either I may be correct and it just being a landscape made from a storm or I could be wrong and its a living organism. We will never know unless we do the research. ",
    "Are your students struggling to attend class on a daily basis and can't keep up with their work? Well, we are here to help By doing online schooling, not only would students benefit from being able to attend classes at home but because the students can go at their own pace have no distractions and have a better and more comfortable work environment. However, some people might disagree with this and say students do not gain or benefit from attending an online class at home rather than attending to a public school. Others might say this because there are no distractions at public schools and the students can still go at their own pace. For example, students can still go at their same pace in the classroom because if the teacher is going too fast, then the student can tell the teacher to slow down. Nevertheless, there are other view points to consider To begin with, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes at home because students can go at their own pace. For example, while students are at home doing their online school work, they do not need to rush themselves and they can take it at the pace where they learn the material accurately and in the most effective way possible. Therefore, this would result in the students to attend their online classes more often because they are understanding the material while going at their own pace. In addition, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes at home because there are no distractions For example, by students not having any distractions at home because they are doing online work, this would help increase productivity and minimize side conversations rather than going to a public school. By doing this, the students doing online work will turn in their assignments on time which will help them in the near future. Thus being said, online classes from home would definitely benefit and encourage many students do their work instead getting distracted and having side conversations. Finally, students can benefit from doing online classes by having a better and more comfortable work environment. By having a better and more comfortable work environment for students, this can help them in many different ways. For example, students that do online courses at home work better and more efficient because they can have more help from a teacher in a comfortable environment that the student can enjoy. By doing this, students tend to learn the material faster and in a better environment. In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes at home because they can go at their own pace, have no distractions, and work in a better and more comfortable work environment. By doing this, not only will students get many benefits from working at home, they will learn at their own pace. So the next time your students don't come to class, sign them up for online schooling.

    "I am writing to you today on the subject of community service. I do not support this requirement, not because i think it is bad, but the time it would take would be too much for some students. Some students are already very busy, and adding community service projects would just make it busier, and harder on them. Some students play sports, and have practices every night, others have band rehearsals. On top of all that, they all have homework, putting required community service projects on top of all that would confuse us students, we would have trouble focussing on our academics if we have to worry about getting so many things done. I myself am in many extracurricular activities, i play many sports, i play in the band, and i sing in the choir, i have a sports practice every night, and i have homework to do after that. To me, requiring community service would set me over the limit. I myself am already extremely busy every night, and having to worry about getting my community service projects done would be too much for me to handle. i also have many friends that play many sports, and other things.

    "Cell phones one of the most important technology in today world since cells phones have been created almost no one can do without them. Phones are so important to us that we need them in case of emergency. family or friends that are away from us or international from a different county. we all known that driving is one of the number one cause of death. While driving is a privilege we have today. When you text and drive you not only put yourself at risk you put innocent drives at stake Just recently the state of Georgia ban the use of cell phones while driving. I believe there is no text back to that person that can not wait. We should take life precious. in the UK cell phones are banned. I believe all call phones should be banned. Recently researchers have come up with a way of using our phones while driving.\nIn order to do that they have came up with advanced vehicle that we can make phone calls with touching our phones by using the aux. I hope as we move forward in life people can learn from each other's mistakes. Texting while driving is the worst thing to do you can . loose your privilege or suspended license. Even worse you could kill someone while walking. So the question is does it really worth texting while driving? ",
    "Phones are a huge part of our children's lives.\nIn your first policy you state that you could,\n\"Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.\"\nIn your second policy you state that you, \" Do not allow students to have phones at school at all.\" In my opinion policy number one is the best decision that you could make regarding the students. The reason i say this is because by letting them have there phones, even at a potion of time, you would not have them sneaking them around as often. \nYour letting them have some freedom when it comes to communication, but at the same time you have control over them. If you chose the second policy you would have a lot of angry parents at your door. Parents and children need to communicate, and they do this, most often than not, on there phones.\nIf you took away the only way parents could communicate and talk to their children, all these parents would be upset, and of course worried.\nFor you see, they would not know if there children were home or gone off to friends house, and they couldn't just call them up and ask because there phones would be with them, but at home. So, please take into consideration what I've said to you.",
    "Cell phones should be allowed in schools, but only during lunch periods or on their free time. Cell phones are a very big distraction for a student, especially if they're a middle or high schooler. Many schools these days don't really care if a student has their cell phone out during class. But having their cell phones out is hurting themselves and their education. For example, like I said before, cell phones is a huge distraction. Especially for their education. School is for learning, not for talking or texting their best friends. Texting can affect how a student can learn. Instead of paying attention to what the teacher's talking about, they might be paying attention to the plans they'll be doing this weekend. Having your cell phone out during classes is a huge problem, but during lunch periods or their free time isn't that much of a bad idea. For example, maybe a student needs to call their parents to see if they can go over to a friends' house after school. Or they need to see if they'll be getting picked up from practice. Students can do that during their free time, which isn't bad at all. Secondly, texting can affect a student's grammar, punctuation, vocabulary, and their spelling. It could basically hurt their English education. For example, \"hey. wats up. do u wan2 go 2 my house 2nite\" That sentence there has a major problem! If students get used to texting like that, they might as well get used to writing and typing like it. There were many errors in that sentence. For example, that sentence didn't have any capulization or the correct punctuation. There were many spelling errors and numbers and words do not make a good couple at all. Texting will affect a students' education with how they portray their words and writing them. Lastly, with the subject of their education, if students have their cell phones out during class, it can cause to cheating. If a quiz or a test is taking place, students can easily whip their phones out of their pockets and text their friends the answers to the problems. That, I think, is totally not acceptable. Also, there are tools on a cell phone that a student can use to cheat on their assignments or tests. They can use their calculator in math when they are not supposed to, or they can use a dictionary to look up a word or definition when a calculator is not needed. A cell phone will not also affect their education, but it can help cheat with it also. As a result, cell phones are only used during free times, not during school. Communication with friends and family electronically is not appropriate during classes. School is meant for students to learn and get a better education. Although cell phones aren't acceptable during classes, they can give a student in much use in case of an emergency. All in all, cell phones and school are two different things that should not be combined together. It can hurt a students' education such as cheating, as a distraction, and with their grammar, spelling, punctuation, and vocabulary. Cell phones should not be allowed in use during classes but only during a students' lunch period and their free times.",
    "The school system may not be the brightest, but it upholds many realistic standards for students. Psychological and social demands of school are challenged by every individual's effort they put in. Being present in school has many unseen pleasures to our daily lives that will enforce a better future for students Therefore, Students would benefit more being in school then working at home. Every student has their demands and effect on its social life. With the wide spectrum of students use on their social life, it's certain that everyone has their need for it. Last year on summer break, everyday was passing by in an instant. Before i could even really grasp of how i could make each day more useful, school was going to begin in a week. I had not spent a single day with my friends and i could barely be happy anymore. Being extremely uncomftorable interacting with anyone after summer ended, i was not well adapted into a healthy social life anymore. Being around friends and friendly classmates is a mandaotry essence of being a human being. Developing the skills to meet new people and friends/classmates is a reason why school is more benefitial then working at home. Having an online video that teaches you the information needed to know makes it difficult for students to get the right help they need and transition it to understanding the subject better. Having a teacher will give you real time feedback and possible work arounds to personal problems on the topic. On May 11, 2019, we had our SOL for my Geometry class. I had been sick the whole week before, meaning i was fully relying on the online information that was present and available to me for the possible instance of students being absent. Not only was the notes harder to memorize, but there werent any acrynoms or tips that teachers would sneak into their lessons. Searching up the questions had only showed me methods other use that were too complicated. Direct communication to the teachers will always be more benefitial then relying on the internet or given videos. \nHaving ease of access to learning the work and working at your own pace may present itself to be a better option then going to school, yet it ironically hinders their efforts and understandings. School schedules will have a set plan of each day, and each class will have teachers that plan the way the subject is being tought. Having a plan to follow will prevent students to get a set work done by a certain time. Procrastination is almost inevitable when relying on video conferencing or work at home. I cant help but play video games on my phone while doing work as i have the instant ease to do so. Spending so much time on media that i squeeze my work to late at night or early in the morning. Not only that, but a lot of the times, being too comftorable will make your life harder in the future Even if students dont seem to enjoy school, it is very important and essential for proper development into the future of everyone. Nothing can be perfect, and that goes with school system as well. Yet the benefits greatly overweight the consequences. In essence, students would overall gain more being part of the schools community and working hard then not understanding the work given and sustaining a harder social life working at home.",
    "An industrial world without cars may seem to be ages away, but according to the studies conducted in the passages, the reduction of car use is very positive culturally, environmentally, and even economically. One advantage of a society without cars is a relief of stress. The residents of Vauban, Germany, a car-free suburban town, are much happier there. They don't have to deal with the pollution of gas emission or noise pollution from traffic; they simply hear bicycles swishing by and children playing. Car free towns have been an intriguing idea for years now; even major organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation for America are willing to pursue car-free cities for many reasons. The major motivation for getting rid of cars is pollution. In Europe, 12% of gas emissions come from cars, and in some car-intensive areas in America, gas emissions from cars reach 50%. There was even a ban on driving in Paris for a short while when the smog became too hectic. That's a massive amount of pollution- an amount that can be greatly reduced. Some countries are slowly getting on board with the whole \"car-free\" idea. In Bogota, there's a car free day where everyone takes alternative forms of transportation to get around, be it buses, bikes, or skateboards, which makes a huge difference in such a heavily populated metropolis. The citizens really enjoy this day, hinting that a car free life is more enjoyable. This car free day has even spread to other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupar and will soon spread to other countries as well. If a car free society is ideal, how come we don't have it yet? Currently, we still depend greatly on cars; giving them up wholly is a very radical change. However, governments are working into it slowly. On top of car-free towns like Vauban and car-free holidays like in Bogota, car-free cities are being planned. These cities would be very dense, making it easier to get around with a bike, on foot, or on public buses and metrorails rather than in a private car. This will reduce pollution greatly, spawn a healthier population, and even support local business growth now that local restaurants will be a walk away from one's home. It is even evident in America that the amount of people getting drivers liscences has been dropping steadily. Culturally, everything is growing to be more local: carpools, public transportation, and the internet keep eveyone connected without having to use private cars. In the final analysis, shifting towards a society that is less dependent on cars will bring about very positive results. People will be able to enjoy a more local, connected, and happier environment and nature will flourish too with the relief of pollution, both in the form of noise and gas emission. Hopefully, the reduction of car use will be well under way in the near future and we can progress, improving society and repairing the global ecosystem. ",
    "I feel like it would be a great idea to have Driverless Cars It'll prevent people from crashing into others and risking their lives it'll decrease chances of trafic on express ways And marketing would sky rocket. Many people would love to travel places but they'll get lazy to drive, but if they have a car that can drive itself then it would make it better on the humans life aswell.\n Many people also agree on how bad it is. Honestly it does have some flaws and miss happs. One of them are getting sent to a different location. Just like G.P.S., you type in your address and sometimes it sends you somewhere you didn't want to go. A Driverless Car is like a driving G.P.S., it could also have a malfunctioning problem it could put your life at risk and others. At the end of the day technology will have a lot of malfunctioning problems and a Driverless Car will be one of them. So be smart and purchase one at your own risk. ",
    "\nThe robust political system of the American government is greatly hindered by the Electoral College. The Electoral College isn't completely representative of what citizens really want. History will prove such logic with just a simple recollection of past events. \"Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new elector who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, \"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and case a deciding vote for whomever they please.\"\n(Paragraph 11) Americans are not getting the representation we deserve. In fact, in a democracy, we should be representing our own beliefs, ourselves. The Electoral College must be totally abolished and the popular vote should become the new standard for political voting. \n Time and time again, we have been shown that the Electoral College is nothing but a gimmick and \"a compromise between election of President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\"\n(Paragraph 1)\nby the founding fathers. Maybe that had worked in the past, when the population was statistically low compared to today, and citizens were less informed because of the lack of media avaliable, like the internet and television. But, it is not working today. The 2000 election serves as an example of a faulty system. \"According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\"\n(Paragraph 9)\nTherefore, this is an obvious majority of citizens who agree with me. The Electoral College is almost universally despised, and not considered the most effective way to elect a President. \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.\"\n(Paragraph 13)\nThis is ridiculous and not at all fair to voters. In this sense, it is absolutely true that every vote doesn't count. Unless you're in a swing state, your vote may mean very little in the grand scheme of things. Every legal American deserves the right to a balanced and fair election with a true, meaningful vote. Claims by supporters of the Electoral College are not effective. In fact, one writer finds Swing States to be a good thing! Yes, \"Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign--to really listen to the competing candidates--knowing they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\" \n Seriously, that is absurd. Every voter should have the right to know they are going to decide the election This writer is implying that the small state votes are useless, and that the voters in them don't even pay attention to campaigns or research before they vote! As a former resident of a politically smaller-impact state, I know very well that citizens there research thoroughly before they do any voting. Putting thought into a vote isn't just a thing people do in large states. Maybe it will be that way in the future, because due to the Electoral College, votes there don't even matter anymore. Citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice. The Electoral College needs to go, because it makes for an unfair political system that only benefits politicians running, not the average joe.\"It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.\" \n",
    "I don't think that you should require every student to do community service. I think this because everybody should be able to do what they want.\n It would be a good idea to start a little club or something of that sort to do community service.\nOr you could put up a list in the office or right outside of the office for people to participate in doing community service. I don't think everybody should have to do it cause when they are not in school some have things to do like sports and other sorts of clubs. You could also get a class that people could be in to do community service as a class so people could put on job applications and college applications too. A class would also be good for tutoring the elementary, so they wouldn't have to stay after school.",
    "One hundred years ago inovators wouldn't have dreamed of inventing driverless cars. The very thought of an automobile being able to drive itself would have been a feet only the gods could do. In the twentieth century, though, technology has advanced more and more each day and that includes this mind boggling idea Many would say that driverless cars are unsafe and would needlessly use up time and energy but the truth of the matter is, driverless cars are our doorway to another world of inventions that could not only benefit our daily lives but save others as well. Inovators around the globe agree that self-driving cars are, at least, a great accomplishment for humanity. Until 2009 cars, such as these, did not even exist; because of the brillant minds of many amazing inovators, we can now say that humans are one step closer to a new type of world that doesn't have to involve death because of irresponsible and reckless drivers. In the passage \"Driverless Car are Coming\" the author even states that \"The in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.\" Of course the author is right, but what about all the sensors cars like these would come equipped with? Many say that these cars would lead to disaster and countless car accidents but, in fact, these cars are safer than any other we have seen before. Although we are not quite ready for driverless cars to be driven around town, inventions, such as these, are what make our civilization so unique. Self-driving cars are not only impressive because of how complicated they are, but the idea that someone could have to think that these cars could be made possible. Driverles cars are safe and might include back-up options in case something goes wrong and the driver needs to steer. Law-makers feel these automobiles cannot be safely driven around other individuals but they have obviously not looked into how able these cars actually are. These cars are what gives us a chance at other inventions that we cannot even fathom down the road. These automobiles are what will insure that our futures may be just a bit brighter because of these self-abled cars. ",
    "Driverless cars wouldn't be able to sense where pedestrians, any animal, or buildings that are in area. Without there being a driver available, the world would be horrific.

In paragraph 7 it states the model in 2013 BMV,\nnotifies the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, naviation through work zones and so forth.. What if the buttons you were accessed to sensor the car stopped working in the progress of you being on the road? What if the system got corrupted, and begin to not function with those features described? It would be putting your enviorment in danger, as well as yourself. driverless cars shouldn't be a factor anywhere Due to minors, systems being corrupted, or the simple fact that it's no one to blame for damages or deaths it could lead. The government, or the president would have deal with each matter if the cars became a law. Who has that much time on their hands? Is the invention really worth putting yourself and surroundings in harms way? ",
    "I think seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice not all people have the same ideas and they can give them different advise because we all think different Me personally I think this is really good because their were time where i just asked one person for advise and it did not go well and when i asked multiple people it went good and i have a lot of examples that have gone well and bad. One time I needed help with something personal and I asked 4 of my good friend for advise\u00a0and they all told me different things but I\u00a0try to put everything they told me into one idea and try to do it and I did and it went really well and I think if I did not ask more than one person it would have gone well because of the other persons feelings.\nOther time I needed help with my math homework\u00a0and instead of asking multiple people for help i\\I\u00a0only asked for one persons help and I think that was not a great idea because not all people will get what your trying to figure out. I only asked one person for help so it did not go well because i should've\u00a0asked other person to because everyone works differently and they can get different answers.\n So I just think its good if you ask multiple people for help or advise people,who knows if there right or wrong or if its good or bad advise because from my experience its better for you to ask multiple people.",
    "Cell phones have been a great innovation to society and mankind overall, however could these great devices be causing us harm? We have become so very dependent on our cell phones and always being connected that we cannot seem to put them down. Times such as when we are driving or something as simple as a family dinner just is not the same anymore, we are always communicating in some way however not with those who matter most. We sit down at the dinner table and do not talk with our families but our \"friends\" on social media. Not being able to separate our connection with our phones, laptops, tablets, etc. is potentially hurting us by never being able to step away from our devices. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. According to www. edgarsynder. com \"Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field.\" We all are aware of the dangers of texting and driving yet many many of us still do it, myself included I am torn between the practicality and the legality of the situation. My state of Georgia has a \"hands free\" law. Meaning your phone cannot be in use or on your person in any way, shape, or form.\nAt least Twenty four states have hand held or texting and driving bans in the United States. Montana is the only state with no ban whatsoever. In my personal opinion there should be texting bans for everyone in all states and be allowed to talk on the phone if they please. ",

    "Venus is possibly the closest to Earth in size and density then and other planet. Which, makes you belive that just maybe, us humans can live on Venus just as we do live on Earth Even tho Venus is very similar to our Earth it is very different. For example, Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. Even the surface is affected and can average 800 degrees Farenheit. Even though these conditons are too extreme for our human kind. We can possibly create something or discover something greater that can withstand all of those extreme enviorments. Earth has an abundant of shapes and sizes of clouds. Not only do we have clouds that not only look beautiful, we also tend to have clouds that can harm us. Between a mixture of fog and rain it creates smog,which, can harm our skin. Not only does Earth have clouds, Venus does too. But Venus has clouds that can potentially kill all of human kind or melt through many types of metal Venus has these very high corrosive sulfuric acid clouds in the atmosphere that would be a big problem for us humans to explore Venus. all of these conditions on Venus doesnt have to be as problem as long as we can create or discover something to counteract the conditions.

    "I would agree with keeping the Electoral College because its a fair way to elect the president of the united states. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors the majority only 270 votes is required for the final dessision. Each candidate running for the president has his or her own group of electors but the state law varys how many are selected. The presidential election is held every four yearson the tuesday after the first monday of november.\nThe states are called districts for example the word state also refers to the disrict of Columbia. You can help choose your states electors when you vote forpresident. Even though your voting for your candidate your really voting for the candidates electors. Most states have a winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. After the presidential election your govenor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of your candidates who ran for president in your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state at the meeting of the electors in December. Then the certificate is sent to the congress\u00a0 and the national records of the presidential election. ",
    "Home schooling, also known as home education, is the education of children at home, it is usally conducted by a parent, tutor, or an online teacher. Many families use less formal ways of home school in North America, whereas \"home education\" is only used elsewhere. Before the introduction to compulsory, school attendance laws most education was done at home. Homeschooling can affect social life. Attending public schools all your life you know a lot of people. So I think homeschooling can cause depression or cause anybody who tries home education to be lonely. In many states home education goes on as an alternative to public and private schools. In other nations home schooling is illegal so students have no choice but to attend public or private schools. In the legal states students can be home schooling for many reasons. Some reasons can be like parents not wanting their kids around others while learning. Other reasons can be dealing with being kicked out of school and no other schools will accept you because of behavior. In my society today I know a few people that have been kicked out school and forced to be home schooled online. Being kicked out of school can be good or bad. It can be good for students that don't learn well at school, but bad for those who learn well in school. If kicked out others may need more help and start to cheat on the work and look up answers. Causing them not learn as much as they did back in public schools. So if students know they wouldn't be able to learn well with a online teacher they shouldn't do anything to get kicked out school. I think some students fit in the classroom and others need more help like hands on or close up. Disabilities could cause a student to seek help in person with a certified teacher. Not everyone learns the same way so not just everybody can attend classes from home. Everybody learns in their own way. Overall I think home schooling is a good thing. It can prevent school fights. Also prevent skipping and being late to school missing insructional time. If I had the choice to home school I would do it. I feel it is a great choice to make. Therefore my stance on this prompt is home school or online classes. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ",

    "In today's world, technology is everywhere. Technology helps assist in everyday tasks and brings about new levels of creativity. In this new age of innovation, smart cars fit right in with all other aspects of our digitalized lives. Not only could driverless cars help in many other ways regular cars can't, but they also allow for an increase in safety potential. Overall, driverless cars will be beneficial for the modern world. The use of driverless cars can vary from ecofriendly transportation to customization for individual scheduals. By using driverless cars as a taxi system, gas consumption would majorly decrease. The taxi system idea could also lead to new ways of public transportation. These cars could take their passengers anywhere they needed to go through a direct route. Passengers would no longer have to wait for long periods of time on buses for their stops. These driverless systems would allow for greater flexibility overall. Driverless cars would also help communities everywhere with safety. Since these smart cars are loaded with sensor technology, they can help limit the amount of crashes that were regularly happening. The protypes of driverless cars have gone millions of miles without crashes and could help stunt the commonality of vehicular crashes and deaths. Driverless cars could also aide with the safety for learning and elderly drivers. Oftentimes, teenage drivers and drivers with slow reaction times are the causes of accidents that could have been avoided with easy assistance. Smart, semi-driverless cars could be the answer to these costly problems. Ultimately, driverless cars would have an extreme influence on today's society. The assistance from technology has changed the world we live in and will continue to do so. Driverless cars are the step in the right direction for driving innovations all across the world. ",
    "Driverless cars can be a positive thing it can prevenet fewer accidents notifies when it wants the driver to take control of the wheel, it can help a lot of disabled people we can prevent fewer accidents when people are drinking they won't have to worry that much about crashing or spending their money on taxis for when they want to go home. They still have to be careful so when the car tells them to take the wheel, they are ready for it. As well with younger people, when they first start driving they can be lessed worried that they will have an accident, but it will be difficult to get them to focus since they aren't at the wheel. Younger drivers will be distracted by texting it notifies the driver when there is danger. As it tells you in paragraph five, \"...those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\" Since 2013, the BMW have modified a car that will vibrate a drivers seat when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. \"The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.\"Paragraph seven informs the reader about everthing the BMW has done so that the car can drive by itsself. when you really think about it not only will these cars prevent fewer accidents and notify when it wants the driver to take control of the wheel but it can help a lot of disabled people. For those people who have a hard time driving this would be perfect for them because it's basically driving by itsself and they would rarely touch the wheel. For the people who can't drive because they aren't capable of following the rules of the road, this car would be good for them. Driverless cars can be a positive things because this car will prevent fewer accidents, it will notify the driver when it needs to take control of the wheel and it will help out a lot of disabled people.

    "I've heard the news and its been a disappointment to us all but i agree in this section of concern. However i believe with strong observation if a student is showing potential effort in their weak subjects they she be allowed to play an activity. Sports are a future preference in career sometimes and are highly devoted to So if you were not to give students a chance in school it would be a chance that they would lack even more in their working habits. Also i understand the circumstances on how sports or other activities can distract the affect a child's well being when it comes down to school. Some children rely on what they love to do and while so they forget the most important task in the mist of it all. Their education. I believe you are right for stopping at the common grade to prevent further failure and from this certain point on students should be asked to focus their views on school work. After a week with limited sports and there is no change in the legal academic grade they should be removed from the active cycle. This method can come in handy when working with not only adults but children also.",
    "Today, majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. There is a new law called \"hands free\" where people that own a cell phone cannot operate it while driving. This has effected people that own motor vehicles in many ways. People need their phones to direct their self's places or answer emergency texts or calls. The new \"hands free\" law is a law where no one can hold their phone while driving. This has effected people with older cars and even newer cars to this day. As this law is in set, people have to connect their phone to Bluetooth to be able to talk on the phone. For example, if you're driving and someone calls, you have to have your phone connected to Bluetooth to be able to talk. In some cases this can be bad for the driver and other people driving on the road also. If your phone isn't connected to Bluetooth while you're driving, there can be a high risk of a crash when you're connecting your phone to Bluetooth. In some cases, there could also be an emergency call you have to answer, and people that don't have Bluetooth in their car can be effected by this law The \"hands free\" law shouldn't be a law. Although the government thinks the hands free law is going to help the risk of crashes, the hands free law could be much less safe than using your hands. \"Incredibly, they also spent less time watching the road, even when they were texting by voice.\" Stated in the Text Free is No Safer to use while driving. The Texas A&M Transportation institute studied people driving a closed course under three conditions: while texting by hand, while texting by voice, and by not texting at all. It seems as if texting by voice should be safer than looking at your phone, but studies show that texting by voice and by looking at your phone, the reaction time is still the same. The hands free law can affect you in a positive or negative way. Yes, talking on the phone while your driving is a dangerous distraction. \"Many studies have shown that the level of distraction has more to do with the intensity of the conversation\" Stated in the \"Total bans may be impractical\" debate. Studies show, an in depth conversation that requires a good deal of thought causes a higher level of distraction than a relatively short. The time and the length of the phone call is what is dangerous. Even though the hands free law can help with the risk of car accidents and keep people off their phones while driving, studies have shown that wether your texting by voice or looking at your phone the risk of crashing is the same. The hands free law should not be in play. ",
    "Imagine a world where people no longer control their vehicles, the machines they used to buy for the pleasure of driving and not just to get around while playing on their phones. Terrifying right? With the idea of driverless cars coming into view in this modern day and age we must pause from imagining the cool idea of these automated automobiles, and imagine the scary possibilities that very likely could come along too. Many of the people who push for driverless cars only see the idea of a car coming to them withouth them even having to move a muscle. However, these people most likely haven't conscidered the dangers and downfalls of the self driving cars. we as a people will become lazy, forget the enjoyment that can come from driving most importantly create many new risks and dangers in the driving world. These days many people are already too lazy to even walk, but imagine if people no longer even have to drive. With automated cars becoming a possibility many are losing their minds over the idea of being able to get around without having to put forth any effort. These people may have learned to drive at one point, but with automated cars they may forget how to drive causing huge problems if they ever need to drive a car that can't drive itself. If we create these self driving cars we will end up with an entirely new breed of lazy people who most likely won't drive their car, let alone walk The possibility of these lazy folks may be tragic, but is easily moved aside by the fact that self driving cars will take away the enjoyment driving can bring. Many years ago an idea was fromed that would bring the demise of horseback travel and this idea was the car. Since the day the first car was produced driving has brought many people an immense pleasure that is unrivaled. For years people would save their hard earned cash for the newest car just to feal the power or gentleness it had while they crused the open roads for hours just their car and them. Now that pleasure is being threatened by the idea of self driving cars. With these new cars we will no longer have this pleasure. These self driving cars take away the enjoyment of showing off how nice your car handles or how fast you can drive it as the car does the driving and controls the speed taking away the freedom and pleasure we once had. Although losing the enjoyment of driving is robbery, the dangers of these new cars heavily out weighs our loss of pleasure. Today's dangers of driving are things such as speeding and lack of awareness; however the dangers of self driving vehicles are much worse. When in a current vehical the dangers of driving are mostly things we can prevent such as rekless driving and lack of attention. With self driving cars they could malfunction leaving no time to correct the vehical meaning an accident or even worse such as death. If a self driving car is having issues the driver may not even be away and seconds later could lose their life. With human controlled cars we have time to correct ourself and most of the time are aware of problems with the vehicle, but not with cars we don't control. These possibilities brought on by self driving cars should be seen before we make the leap to the next generation of travel. When lazy people, no enjoyment of driving, and new dangers are the risk of self driving cars we should stop and take a moment to think. When I see the risks of these new vehicles I already know that they outweigh the non existant need for self driving cars. These self driving cars bring much more negative than positivie and I disagree with the idea entirely. Take a look at people driving in this day and age and the answer of yes and no for self driving cars is obviously no.",
    "The article of \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" gives some positive and negative situations on the driverless cars. In my opionion I would be most certainly against the driverless car. A lot of safety is at risks with thesekind of cars. The sensors with these cars are very imporatnt and what if they all broke? The cars would be useless. If a car isn't safe by law it can not be used and the driverless cars have no safety concepts about them at all.\nFor instant saftey. The sensors , are the most important object in the car especially the roof sensor. What if the roof top sensor completly just stop working, there would be nothing anyone could do. If any of the senors went out on iany driverless cars the owner couldn't even use his/her car. The driverless cars could also shout down at anytime out of nowhere and there would be nothing to do for it. These driveless cars can also take off on there own when the driver isn't even ready to start to take off and go. Companies are just making these cars becuase they think that they are cool and that some peolpe out in the world are thinking that there cool too. They also know that they can get lot's of big money of these driverless cars. Driverless cars should not go pass the law where it says that \"traffic laws are written with assumption that only safe cars has a human driver in control at all times.\" Driverless cars are not safe at all and a human diver isn't in control of the car, the car is doing it all on its on. \"If the technology fails and someone is uinjuried, who is at fault ... the driver or the manufacturer?\" Automakers swear that they are \"continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.\" But when really will all of these problems with the driverless cars will be all the way solved? The driverless cars are at risk Even the own automarkers do not know what all the driverless cars are capble of.\n Driverless cars are very expenice. Are these companies going to keep the driverless cars coming if there wasn't any money made of them? Know one is even for sure that anyone evens wants a driverless car. Most people that are drivers say that they like the control of driving that there the power of the car. To have a car doing just about everything in the car wouldn't that kind of be a little scary don't you think? Dangerous situations can happen from the driverless cars They may think they have gotten everything figured but no one truly will. I'm really against the driverless cars because I just believe that something is just going to go wrong with the car. With all the sensors having to be used. \"The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel?\" What's it's purpose? Humans have the reason to drive and learn on how to drive so, what's the point to take it away? Driverless cars are just something else in this world people are trying to make up for the \"furture\" and to get BIG money off of people. Against driverless cars is the smarter way to go these cars have the control and with all the control of a car you'll never know what's it about to do. Car accindentscould possible go up from the driverless cars. Theirs already to many people dying in this world there doesn't need to be anymore from the driverless cars. ",
    "Making choices is hard sometimes, but getting advice from people makes it easier to make that choice. Advice can point you the right way that you want to go, or it can show you what you don't want to do. This is why its important to get multiple opinions. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice someone to get different perspectives, compare and contrast opinions be confident and sure about their decision. Everyone has a different perspective, so when asking for advice different people are going to see the situation differently and give different advice. Getting different perspectives helps you see the situation in ways other people see it. Only having one perspective means you may think that there is only one right thing to do, but by seeing the situation the way others do you could discover that there is a better option. Walking in somebody elses shoes can help you make a better decision for not only yourself, but everyone. Not only does everyone have a different perspective, but everyone has a different opinion as well. When you ask for advice people give you their opinions of what you should do. Comparing and contrasting these opinions shows you what opinions are most similar to yours and which are completely different from your opinions. If you compare someones opinion to yours it can also show you what choice you do not want to make. Comparing and contrasting is like weighing the pros and cons of each option Seeking multiple opinions helps you make a more confident decision Making the right choices can take time but if you seek multiple opinions by getting different perspectives, compare and contrast the opinions, and be confident in your choice, you will have made the best decision you could have made.",
    "I recommand you to keep the Electoral College The Electoral College consists of 538 electors The Electoral College process consists of selection of the electors each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors .\n To begin with , i think the state senator should keep the Electoral College because it a fantastic college . Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President .The District of Columbia Is Allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a process , not a place. The Electoral College is widely regared as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winter . The Electoral College process consists of selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for presisdent and Vice president , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress . The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday In November. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year . Last but not least , Let me remind you that each candidate running for president in you state has his or her own group of electors There Usually selected by the candidates political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent tot he Congress and the National Archives as part of the offcial records of the presidential election . After the presidential election , your governor prepares a ' Certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ranfor president in your state along with the names of their respective\u00a0 electors .

    "Driving while using a cellular device is very dangerous, but it can be useful at certain times. The use of cellphones ranges from informational, to recreational activities. The use of cellphones during driving can be catastrophic not many people have the skills to watch the road and their phone at the same time. The fact of the matter is that it's too dangerous to let people use cell phones while they drive, the accidental crashes that happen each year would skyrocket. I advocate for a ban of drivers using cellphones while driving.\n \"Approximately 660,000 drivers try and use cellphones behind the wheel of an automobile\" according to edgarsnyder. com. This is extremely risky as not being focused while driving can lead to death by car crash, not just for the driver at fault but everyone in the crash. The drivers of America need to be attentive when operating a vehicle because of: pedestrians, stop signs, public and or private property, cars, trucks, etc. The mortality rate of people in car crashes are very high, and the property damages done are very extreme, not to mention that it can cause problems later in life as well. Overall it's not even worth the trouble to use your cellular device while driving.\n To look at the perspective through another person's shoes is the key to understanding why this is true. The thought of leaving this world or being the cause of someone else leaving this world is enough for me not to even think about using a cellphone while driving. The hearts of the family members who had their loved ones taken away makes me tear up. A great man once told me, \"all life is precious and it is not up to man but our creator to take it away. \" There is nothing more wrong than knowing that you took a human life and that is the reason I think cellular device use during driving, should be illegal.

    "Driverless cars seem like an amazing jump into the future.\nThey would be a great addition to public transporation or maybe even personal use.\nGoogle has already made some effort to making this dream a reality. Although, these cars are not fully independent to be driving by themselves.\nI believe that driverless cars would not only be better for our means of public transportation, but better for our environment as well. Googles invisions would highly support my position.\n The company is making efforts to have a public transportation system of driverless taxis.\nWith this improvement, today's taxis fuel usage would be halfed.\nUltimatly, the less fuel used is almost always better for our environment.\n Although, it seems with every advance in technology, there is often a down side. The driverless cars are not exactly safe with modern technology. It is said that the cars can only do so much, needing a human to do some work at times.\nThe cars would need help with complicated traffic, work zones, and accidents.\nSome accidents could even come from the cars themselves.\n With the good and bad, driverless cars have much improvement to reach better safety requirements.\nThey wil help with minimizing the usage of fuel and public transportation trafic.\nThese cars have a ways to go, but thats nothing automakers can't solve.",
    "we should not abolish the Electoral College, the Electoral College has many benefits when voting for president. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anchorism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president In 2012 the election for president, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to Romneys 51.3. Because most states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the slightest plurality in a state can cause a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. Though a tie is possible because the total number of votes is 538, it is very unlikely. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal No state has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The voters in toss-up states are more likely to be the thoughtful voters. A large state will recieve more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. ",
    "Teacher-based or student-based summer project, which is better? Some schools require students to keep their mind thinking even during summer break. They use summer projects to help their mind stay awake. students completing the project would rather make it themselves than have a teacher assign the project to them. they will make it more fun and interesting for themselves, they will make the project easier for them to understand, they will enjoy doing the project since it will be from their prospective. Although a student-based project would be more enjoyable for them to complete, a teacher based project would be more effective for both the teacher and the student. The teacher would make the project how it's supposed to be because they know what the students are supposed to learn over the summer. Having the students make their own project would make it to easy for them and the teacher would not really know what is going on because the kids are not going to school. Teachers would want the students to know the proper materials for the next school year even if it mean't just writing a summary of a book. The summer project should be a teacher-based project because it informs the teacher of what is happening and what they are doing during the project, it helps the student learn what they need to maintain in their brain during the summer, and it also makes sure the project is not to easy or hard for the students. The student would not want to spend their summer doing a boring project because that would mean that they would put it off until the end of summer or they might just not do it at all. Having a project that makes them go outside and explore the world is very interesting and would make anyone want to do it. Students need motivation and having the project be something fun like go to an amusement park and explain what your see. If a teacher really wants a student to spend their summer doing a project, there has to be a motivation factor or something that makes them want to complete the project. Student could work in groups to make it easier. It would not necessarily be the whole project being easier it would just be making short cuts to get to one point faster. The groups would be people who are already friends and that would motivate them to do the project because then while doing work they still hang out with their friends. Making the project easier might also mean that the students might be able to understand it better and if they do need help the can ask their peers or email the teacher. What older teachers think young students like might not always be what they like. Students like to explore and be who they want to be but teachers might make a stay at home project. Teenagers and students are also very impatient they do not like to do activities for a long time. This project should have a two week period to complete then the students will complete it faster and will make them more prepared for the next school year. This all makes the students and teachers life easier. Summer is mean't to be spent away from school so having to complete a project is more then enough fro the students. If the student has a problem which their project they can just ask their peers or they can ask the teacher. It should not be very difficult for the student and schools should only make this a mandatory projects but not make it take up all of the students summer. Neither do teachers want to be grading a bunch of projects at the beginning of the school year when everything just started again.",
    "Today, students go to school to pass, rather, than to learn. Students' views have changed because children have lost motivation. They see school as rather a task than something that will help them in the future. I, for one, see school as more of a prison. My assignments are chosen for me and I am forced to go to school from September to June. The break I look forward to, summer, is a time for relaxation and fun. A school project during summer, for learning, is anything but fun, unless it could be. A student-designed project would allow students to express their themselves in a different way get more freedom from their teachers, bring change and fun to a student, during their well deserved break. In school, students are rarely able to show their creativity and passions through the set curriculum. Students' identities are set based on whether, how well they do or do not do in school. Teachers do not get to see their students' strengths outside of how, \"book smart\" they are. Student-designed projects, however, would be able to change this. Through student-designed projects, students would be able to show a different side of them self Children are forced to attend school by law. We are forced to take tests and do projects that we do not have a say in, or else, we fail. There is no freedom, however, that could change. During our summer, we should get the decision to design our own projects. Our break should not be controlled by teachers like they do normally. When given the choice to do something we enjoy, we will see it less as work, but rather as fun. The common saying, \"If you do what you love, then it will never be considered work,\" is very true in this instance. When doing something enjoyable we often forget that we are doing it. We see it as more of a hobby, rather than a task to complete. While projects should be student-designed, they still can be approved by a teacher to instill that it assures learning. A chance to choose our own path may be seen as risky, but it is really for the better. Learning should be fun and interesting and not a task. We students forget that we are supposed to be learning because we are always being told what to do. Freedom will allow us to see school in a different way. We will feel motivated and interested in the projects we choose, which will allow learning to happen. Student-designed projects would provide a change for students. School assignments are all given and set upon by teachers. There is a certain curriculum, which does not provide change or freedom. There is hardly leeway for students that enjoy different things. Teachers do not realize that students are all different. We all have our own strengths and weaknesses and different preferences. Student-designed projects would allow students to switch things up a bit. Students would be able to be the teacher for once and do something they find enjoyable. Some students like to write, so they could choose to write a report on something they find interesting, while others may take the artistic route and paint something completely different, but while they are still learning. Summer is a break and should be different than what school is normally like for a student. A student works hard throughout the whole school year, so they deserve a reward or change. Student-designed projects would be something they could look forward to during their summer vacation, and not something they might dread. An assignment during the summer is already a task, so why not make it a fun task. If a school requires students to complete a summer project they should be student-designed it would allow students to express their creativity, while still learning, freedom, and change. Students will be more motivated and interested when given a choice. Summer is a time for a break after a long school year, so a given assignment should not be something uninteresting to a student. Learning should not be forced and there are many ways to change the minds of students and how they perceive school.\u00a0",
    "This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade. \n \nThis change can do a good change because the students that play a sport or if they are in the band, and if they care more in the activity that they play, maybe that can be distorting the student, that can be the reason of why they don't have good grades, so the students what the students have to study at the same with their sport or other activity, and be good with both . Maybe the students are better in their activity because sometimes we have more fun, and because we like to be in more movement. I have to tell that the idea of tell us about this cange and for give us the opportunity to let us tell you, our opinion is good. ",
    "Summer projects are not always fun to do but to make them fun they should be student-designed. Teacher-designed projects for the summer are really boring and most people dread doing projects in the summer. Although teacher-designed projects are less creative, student-designed projects are more creative. Students should design projects for the summer the projects will be more creative, they will be fun to do in the summer, the students will be more interested in doing the projects.\n if a teacher were to hand out a project, there would be certain things that you would have to follow in order to get a good grade on it. If it were a student-designed project it would have follow a guide line to make sure it is on topic. Another example, every year in elementary school teachers would give a checklist for how many books you read. Students don't want to do that at all but if teachers told the to keep track of what they did through out the summer that might be fun. Students should design the projects because students are more creative than adults and can come up with projects that are fun for them.\n Students should design the projects because they can come up with fun idea's for a project. instead of reading a certain amount of books for a grade, they can set a challenge goal like trying to see who could swim the fastest in a certain amount of time, they can record how much tropical foods they have eaten. Another example, when summer starts students can keep record of how many miles they walked or ran. Students can keep track of how many miles they traveled in the summer and at the beginning of the school year they can see who traveled the most and Whoever had the most can get a special prize. Students should design the projects because the students would have a lot more fun doing the project. if teachers were to design the projects students wouldn't want to really do them. The students would want to do something they're interested in, not an assignment from the teacher for the summer. Another example, Students are interested in what they're doing because they want to. When teachers make the projects they want you to get a good grade but they really don't care if you are enjoying it. Students should design the projects because while they are getting a good grade on them, they are also interested in what they are doing. Students should design the projects because they can enjoy doing the project, they can have fun while doing the project, and also they can be really creative when they need to do a project they're interested in.\u00a0",
    "What is the best method for a students education Students will befit by being able to attend classes from home because students will have more options of class times, students will be less stressed, students will have more personal time. First, speaking from the point of view as a high school student or a college student, trying to find time for classes along with other activities can be difficult. Going to at least five or six classes a day, getting homework, then going to jobs or sports can be hard to manage, especially as a teenager As a student if you are able to work from home and pick the time of your classes it may be more suiting to your schedule. As this type of activity\u00a0is not made for everyone, it may find a way to be useful to every student such as the student can have classes when the teacher video calls the student or when the teacher has a planned class, while others may want to chose when this class happens and if it is by themselves or live with others. While any of these options are available students may even earn a better education at their own pace and their own time without the rush and stress of the surrounding world. Next, a students stress level can go down by taking online classes. As today's\u00a0modern society rises students have more mental issues than a mental patient in the\u00a01920's. This is a very large issue that counties\u00a0to grow, along with many other stressful events and even technology. Stress can cause many things like depression and\u00a0anxiety, but how can schools help with this? While most high schools students worry about the future we want to find a way to help them stress less about these things. By giving the option to students of online classes, students are able to do what they want, when they want, and how they do it. This may allow students to become more open and not feel like they need to fight against others or themselves to be their best self. Students will be able to complete classes on their own time and learning does not have to be as difficult as it appears. By limiting big classes students may not be surrounded by others with a higher level than them and stress about how they are not good enough or need to be better in anyway. Last, students would have access to more personal time. As mentioned before students will most likely have the option of when their classes are and when they do them, this can give the student more access to their own time and any activities. Students can focus on important things like sleep, health, jobs, and other activities then return to their school work at anytime and being able to feel comfortable with their choices without being told how and when to do them.\u00a0Students having more time to relax or enjoy themselves without feeling the stress of school and homework on their chest gives the students the\u00a0ability learn new things and test their minds on what they can really do.\nBy doing online class and giving students more choices and free time the student can learn time management skills and understand what needs to be done, when to get it, and how to complete these task daily. In conclusion, students will befit by attending classes from home because students will have more options of class times and how they wish to mange their time and usage of the day. Students may become less stressed due to when given more options in schooling and learning on your own time at your own pace. Students will have access to more personal time and be able to learn new skills and enjoy themselves without the stress of the modern world.",
    "When it comes to deciding wheather or not driverless cars should be used is up to everybody's own opinion. It is a pretty nice idea thoguh, having cars tat can drive for you while you also payattention is a fantasic idea. take from paragragh 2, on how we have been fasintated by driverless cars. There have been at least more then twenty or so movies that have that idea, look at the movie called \"I Robot\". The cars can actually drive itself, but when it can't do that or when the drive wants to drive it shuts off with a smooth transition from one to the other. In addition, having a car that can drive itself but also have the sensors that need a human touch is a great idea, it makes sure that the driver it paying full attention, but also gives the driver some lee-way room when on the road. In addition, it is great that some cars like the BMW's can drive up to 25 mph when the car is in a area where there could be road work or traffic jams. who will be at fault if the car crashes. If the car has a technology problem, does that mean the manufacurer is to blame or if the car is switching to person driving and it glitches out who is to blame then. In addition, when driverless car start to make advances in the world, does that mean we will no longer need to get driver licences, no longer need to have back ground knowledge on how the roads work and how to operate them if the cars system doesn't work. Will we no longer need to have any background on how to drive and how to operate them. , it is a great advancement in are socitiy today, to have driverless cars, in the long run it make not ne the advancement that everybody will want to have for the future gernerations to come.",

    "I think cell phones should be banned while driving. In the society now cell phones are very popular. People have a habit of texting while they are driving. Texting while driving is very dangerous because you don't know may happen. You may have a car wreck, lose concentration, run off the road,etc. Cell phones have many disadvantages when texting while driving somewhere That's why I think cell phones should be banned from driving. However using a cell phone while driving should be illegal because you should be aware of yourself and the people around you. For example, if you get a text message from someone you can't pay attention to the road and to your phone. You can put many people lives under risk. Majority of the people will continue to do it even if they ban cell phones while driving. Some people don't see nothing wrong with texting while driving. Their are many negative effects of texting while driving. Reading and responding to someone message makes the driver not pay attention to the road. Most people spend most of their time riding on the outside the white line. So therefore doing that activity is very harmful to the whole population. All states should make it against the law to use cell phones while driving. Some people may think they can text while they are driving and not think that it is very dangerous. However, people have to learn from their own mistakes for them to learn. Innocent people lives are being taken because of someone else mistakes. People don't seem to notice how careless they could be while their driving. You don't necessarily have to be texting someone. For example you could be taking pictures, doing something to your radio, watching a video, etc. That's why I think using cell phones while driving should be against the law. In conclusion, texting while driving is one of the biggest problems in the world. I think people should leave their phone alone while driving. However, you should pay more attention to driving instead of being on your phone. Where I live it is a 50 dollar law. That's why I think it should become a law all over the United States. ",

    "Have you ever seen something unusual in the ground? If so do you think it was created by humans or just a natural landform of some sort. Many people believe that most landforms on earth are made by humans The face on mars is a natural landform. If the \"face' on mars was created by alliens it would look a lot different. Many people think alliens look weird, Well the \"face\" on mars wastn't so weird looking. It looked almost like a human face. You would think that alliens would make something radical and not just a face in their planet. Many people seem to believe that they would make something simple. Eventhough many people were not satisfied with the theory that NASA gave them, NASA went on to search for more clues as to which \"alliens made the landform.\" From the pictures that they took you would think that they would be able to detect whether alliens even walked/ touched the surface of the landform. If you think that alliens made the landform, I would suggest you look at the picture more closely. Just because its on a planet like mars doesnt mean it was made by an allien. I mean how many people actually believe in alliens anyway? If you've never seen them how do you know if they even exist? Take another quick look at the picture tell what you think. Is it even possible for alliens to be alive even if it is on another planet? The \"face\" on mars is a natural landform. What leads me to beieve that, is that i dont think alliens are real. Maybe they are real, but why would they make something so simple as a face. Dont you think they wouldve went a little overboard with their creations? ",
    "Imagine a simple situation we have all been thorugh such as getting stuck on a question in your homework or assignment. What would you do? Most people will ask advice from their friends or peers, but there is a chance that their answers may be incorrect. There could be many situations where you feel that it is neccessary to ask for advice. For this reason, whenever you are in a difficult situation, it would be best to ask multiple people for their opinion. But be careful to ask the right people because they might have different opinions that will not be beneficial for you. Young people especially should follow the advice that they think would be most helpful for them because they probably do not have much experience. Asking for multiple advice or opinions can be beneficial by narrowing down the bias in responses, help you make better choices it may guide you through your struggles. A reason why you should be careful with asking the right person for their opinion is because it is likely that they will include bias in their response. For example, when you ask for someone's opinion on which pet you should own, they will more than likely tell you which pet they would like to own instead because they have more knowledge on that particular pet. However, that does not mean that the pet they reccomend would be best for you. Instead, gaining more knowledge about each pet by asking for multiple advice can lead to making better choices. Although some may include bias in their response, their opinions still matter. There is no right or wrong answer when you ask for opinions because you are really asking for their thoughts. In fact, their advice may help guide you through a difficult path that you will have struggles with. If you think about a difficult moment in your life, was anybody there for you, or helped you get through? Sometimes guidance can be what we need. All the advice that people give you can really be helpful at times where you don't know what to do because they can help you choose a better path that you should follow in order to be successful. For example, a difficult moment in your life could be a time where you got sick, and this could be the result of not following your parent's advice to dress warm when you are going outside. At such times when you don't follow advice, the results could lead to something you don't want. If you think you're better on your own, you could be left clueless of what you should do in different situations. Your mind would be blank and anyway, the next thing you would probably do is turn to a friend or a family member for advice. Your family and friends give you reccomendations because they care about you and wish the best for you. Choices are hard to make sometimes, especially when it's between two things you love. It wouldn't be the best to ask others to make choices for you since the results will affect you, not them. However, asking for soemone's thoughts about a specific topic would be beneficial because they can help you out step by step. Even if you don't realize it, choices affect you in some way or another. Making the right choice can be harder than you think, so you have to be careful and think through all the possibilities. If you make a choice that you are not sure of or that you don't trust, the results can have a big impact on you and your future. For this reason, it would be best to ask people who have some experience on the choices you are about to make. recieving advice from multiple people is better than asking from only one person or nobody. Everybody has had times in their life where they did not know how to react or respond to a specific situation. These are the times where you would feel that it is neccessary to turn over to other people for ideas. But sometimes, people who recieve advice are not grateful for it. People who care about you want the best for you, so they give you their opinions and advice so that you can be successful. Advice and knowledge can guide you through in almost any situation. Do not ignore opinions and be thankful for the advice people give you because they might affect your future.\u00a0 \u00a0 ",
    "When a person asks for advice it is most likely they're in a situation that is to confusing or difficult to the point where they don't know what the right solution or choice is. Making choices in life can be hard. Most times they'res never a right choice, but having different people to talk to help you find the best decision. I believe having different opinions when asking for advice can help someone make a better choice the different perspectives the people the advice is coming from the multiple solutions gotten out of it. Talking to different people and getting various perspectives in a confusing situation is helpful because it makes a person start thinking deeper because they all don't have the same opinion. Different points of view can be very helpful because of the different experiences the people could have For example, one of the person asked could've had an experience of being on the other side of a similar situation which could help you think what is at risk or what is gained. Another person could've made a bad choice and learned from their mistake which can give a bigger in site of what is at risk and there could be another person who tells you the complete opposite and make you look at the situation in a whole other way. They can be a lot\u00a0more points of view, but it helps think more thoroughly to find the best choice. When asking for advice the people asked also have an effect on your decision making The people asked don't always have a personal experience or know what to say or how to help you. It is most preferred to ask someone who has experienced something similar or someone who loves and cares about you. For example, getting advice from a friend maybe not the best option because friends nowadays aren't always real friends and don't always want the best for you. Getting advice from a parent or an older sibling could be a better option because they're family, they're more experienced and wise, and most likely want the best for you so their advice would come with the best intentions. Another reason asking for different opinions can help someone make a better choice is the multiple solutions you get out of it Talking to different people helps come up with different paths you can take and helps predict the outcomes. This especially is needed in occasions\u00a0where the situation effect their future. Those decisions need a hard and deep thinking because you're never to sure what could happen that you can regret. That is why finding various paths and solutions is helpful, but it could be hard finding them on your own so that is why seeking for multiple opinions can help find the best choice to make. Overall, I believe talking to different people when asking for advice and getting various opinions can make a positive impact on the choice made because of the different points of view given by the people asked that could agree, disagree, or give you in site on the risks or benefits and the multiple options and solutions obtained. Also asking various people can help rule out the advice that wasn't meant to help you given by the people who don't actually want you to succeed or be happy. So I believe advice on choices, decisions, or on sensitive subjects should be thought through and decided carefully because regret it something someone wouldn't want to carry for the rest of their lives.

    "Allowing students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would be beneficial for students because it would allow them to not have additional school days at the end of the year due to weather allow them to not fall behind on work due to an illness or family situation. By offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, they'll be able to continue their learning while not having to worry about falling behind or having to attend school later into the summer. Many states in the United States get snow on a yearly basis, and as much as students love snow days, sometimes they can hinder a student's learning progress by preventing them from being able to travel to school safely. Many states have a law saying that if too many days of school are canceled due to inclement weather, school days will unfortunately have to be added onto the end of the school year, so students can complete their education for that year. This can cause problems for many students as they might have a summer vacation already planned that'll have to be adjusted due to the extended school year. For instance, there was one year where my county had to add school days onto the end of the year due to additional snow days and that had messed up a lot of student's plans for the summer. Personally, I was able to adjust my vacation plans; however, I had many friends who ended up having to miss the last week of school due to this. If schools offered distance learning on these snow days, where students can still attend class online with their teachers, they can prevent additional school days at the end of the year due to weather. Distance learning by way of online or video conferencing is also beneficial to students because it'll allow them to stay on track with school work and not fall behind due to an illness or family situation. There have been countless times where a student has been sick with a serious illness or had a family situation that prevented them from going to school for a week or so. Just missing one day of school causes a student to fall behind on a lot of work, so missing more than a week of school can definitely hinder a student's learning progress. I've had friends who were sick with an illness, like pneumonia, and were out of school for about two weeks; it took them weeks to be able to catch up and make up all of their missing work. Although a student should rest and recover when they're sick, being able to listen in on class could help them have less work in school significantly. Another example where distance learning is beneficial for students is when they have a family situation. A student might be out of school for a couple days due to a family situation and could fall behind on work. Being able to go to school online or video conference would help that student stay on track with work and not have to spend a week trying to catch up on missed work when they return to school. For example, I had a family member suddenly pass away a while ago, and I had to attend their funeral. As a result, I had to miss a couple of days of school and fell behind on a lot of work. Because it was so sudden, I couldn't plan ahead with my teachers and eventually was stressed out when I came back to school due to the amount of work I had. If online learning had been an option for me, I would've been able to stay on track in school and not have to deal with the stresses of catching up on missed work. I understand that online learning might not be beneficial for all students since each student has their own way of learning and that some students might not have the technology for it at home; however, distance learning would be able to get rid of additional school days due to weather and help a student stay on track when they need to miss school. Online learning could also be implemented easily due to the fact that everyone has a chrome book in school, so many schools could install an app on the chrome book that allows for online learning to be possible. Although many students would not like online learning, I think it would be a beneficial option to implement into the school systems in the long term. Many students struggle during the school year because of missing school days, whether it's due to weather or due to a family situation, and distance learning would be a great option for those students to be able to stay on track with the school curriculum while missing school. Offering online learning will help a student continue their education, prevent them from falling behind in school, and create less stress for them to catch up on missed work; therefore, I think online learning would be beneficial for students and that schools should implement it into their systems.\u00a0",
    "Limiting care usage is an advantage some people were always tense when they had a car and now they're saying they're much happier without it. Vauban is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called \"smart planning\". Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions tailpipes.. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\nIn the United States, the Envirornmental Protection Agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities and legislatores are starting to act, if cautiously. Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog... Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67% of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3% average of diesel engines in the rest of Westen Europe. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer licenses as each year goes by. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.\nPart of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the envirornment, since transportation is the second largest souce of America's emissions, just behind power plants. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves \"mobility\" companies with a broader product range beyond product range beyond the personal vehicle. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit..\nNew York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16-to 39 year olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009... Bill Ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestiran, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportaion traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety. limiting car usage is an advantage. It makes you explore more, get your excercise, try new things instead of always relying on a vehicle to take you somewhere. ",
    "People using their cellular devices while driving is a common thing although its is not safe at all People should not be allowed to be able to use their phones while driving for several reasons. First of all, using your phone while driving would increase the rate of people getting into car accidents. Secondly, if someone sees someone else on their phone they're gonna feel inclined to also be on their phone Lastly, if your hands are busy operating a phone then you won't be able to keep your hands focused on driving. Using your phone while driving would increase the rate of car accidents If your vision is occupied by your phone then you can't possibly pay attention to the road. Therefore if you eliminate distractions then all of your focus and attention can go towards getting to your destination safely. When it comes to car accidents i'm sure most of them were caused by distraction by the phone. Phones while driving just isn't a good idea. Secondly, people are often times prone to suggestion. So if someone is seen on their phone then others are going to follow which can lead to various things. If everyone is no longer paying attention to the road then everyone is in danger. Studies already show that more car accidents are caused by cellular device usage then anything else. Phones can always be accessed so there shouldn't be a hurry. Lastly, if your hands are occupied on the phone then you'll have less control over the steering wheel and other functions . If your hands are on your phone when you need to stop or swerve out of the way you won't be able to do it to the best of your ability because your hands were full. Being able to swerve fully under your control could be the difference between life and death. Lets keep our hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road. In conclusion, using a cellular device is no no when it comes to getting behind the wheel. There are much better things to do when in a car. For example listening to music occupies some people when their driving. Other than that keeping your focus on the road should always be the main focal point when driving. If people feared the consequences then they would be less likely to do it. But as it stands now people don't fear it and that's why they do it with no problem. ",
    "I believe that students shouldn't be able to use their phones at school they become distractions for learning If they use their phones at free time, they could be texting or calling their friends in other classes and cause disruptions. Teens tend to not care about rules and do whatever they want because they feel rules don't apply to them. they will still have their phones on during classes. Students should not be given the benefit of using their phones at school. They will just abuse their privilege and cause trouble in the classrooms. First, students won't listen to the rules They won't listen because they feel they are free to do whatever they want and no one can tell them what to do. They will still use their phones in class even if you make phone usage more available Second, students will be late to class after breaks because they will be so caught up in their phones that they won't pay attention to their class times Students will probably text other students in class who will have their phones on and disrupt the class Finally, students will not pay attention in class They will not pay attention because they are too focused on when they will get a text or a break so they can use their phones. There will be a lot more kids in trouble because of the urge to access their phones. All in all, giving students time to use their phones at school is a mistake and will lead to chaos in class. Students will not benefit from the access to phone usage. Their attitude will make them more stubborn when they can't have something they want. They won't do well in school because their phones become a major distraction. Do not give them this privilege, they will abuse it.",
    "High school is a very difficult environment for kids to learn in. Most kids are too busy trying to fit in or look cool, so they can be part of a clique. Teenagers are also pressured into making bad decisions and do not have time to study or work on anything at home because they dont have the time with all the homework they get Taking high school classes from home would be very beneficial to students and would bring up the overall success rate in high school Students would also be able to get more sleep which can keep them awake and aware of the lesson they are learning. Keeping students at home would also help eliminate\u00a0bullying in schools Most bullying is because of the way someone looks or acts when they stay at home no one can make fun of the way the look or act. This will also help kids with extreme anxiety e when you walk into a test room it can be very intimidating but when you are at home you feel much more relaxed and comfortable. Students staying home is a great way to keep their mental health in a good state. This could also help keep students safe when a student is late and rushing to school in the morning they are likely to speed which could end up causing a accident. Most high schools\u00a0start at around 7:30 forcing their students to wake up at 6 sometimes 6:30 or 7 but yet they also give out homework that can keep them up till 3 AM. Students also have to get jobs to pay for their cars or gas and are still expected to do their homework. Giving homework is not fair to the students at all with staying at home they can finish all their work in time and get a good nights sleep. When they get a full night worth of sleep it can help make them more creative or more productive bringing up the grades of most students They will have time in the mornings to eat breakfast\u00a0as well\u00a0and can get a actually meal for lunch benefiting the health of students Whenever we have Snow or a virus outbreak we have to cancel school this will no longer need to happen as most kids have internet at home and can work from home. When a student gets sick they can easily get into their pajamas get on the computer and do school work while being comfortable The bad part about this idea though is students will not learn how to socialize or how to make good connections with people. Also if a student loses their internet access or has a power outage their is no way for them to attend class besides going to a nearby place with internet There is no doubt that doing online school is much more beneficial then public school. \n Giving students the option of online schooling is a great idea and should be used more often. It will help the mental state of students. It will also help the physical state by letting them get more rest and eating as much as they need to. They can also focus on other parts of life like getting a job or spending time with family instead of doing homework all night. Students will no longer have to take days off anymore bringing up the attendance in high school. Doing this can make high scool a much easier and less stressful environment to learn in. ",
    "Self driving cars are becoming more and more popular as techology advances making it feel like one day in the future we're gonna just ditch the cars all together and we're all going to be hovering around on hover boreds and there wont be a reason for people to learn to drive. Realizing this makes people wonder if there will one day not be a purpose for a drivers license because techniacally they won't be driving. But with everyone just wanting to be in with the new things in the world no one ever thinks about some of the dangers self driving cars could cause. One danger people should be extremly aware of is the independance on the vehicle When people hear the phrase Self Driving Cars they think about something completely different and more advanced than what driverless cars actually are. They instantly assume that they have a free ride to where they want to go and can be oblvious of there surroundings when thats not the case at all. What if there is a malfuction and they have to be ready to take the wheel to keep from drving into a ditch and they arn't. As stated in the article it says \"..the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation comes.\" this means that even though people are not driving doesn't mean they can sit on their phone text and expect there not to be any problems because they can't be so dependant on a machine. Another problem there is with getting the driverless car on the road is the laws that need to be passed to allow them. only three state have allowed them to begin driving on the roads which are \"California,Nevada and Florida\" but even those states keep them on minimum useage for acident prevention. As stated in the article \"..even if traffic law change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident.\" which means that there would be conflicts between owners and manufacturers to see who would be responsible if there were accidents caused by malfuctions. Now there is a diiference between self driving and autopilot. with autopilot people still understand this as you have to be cautious if though they arn't driving they still have to steer. As stated \"Tesla has projected a 2016 reaease for a capable of drivihng atuopilot 90 percent of the time\" this says that even though it's not self drving you can still drive with little to no driving at all.\n Even though it would be cool to have a self drivng car people still need to put safety of themselves and others before buying a driverless car.",
    "Reading ones emotions using technologydoesn sound os bad but it also sounds just as badas it seems to be good technology for someone to have for family use, Mona Lisa was used for this experimet, and showed happiness, and some other objecrs and mostly was happiness, resultingin a somewhat successful attempt at technology.. Im siding for this as it can reveal a persons inner emotions and see if they are suffering on the inside out. Besides, its not everydy you can judge emotion by the face only right? it would only help us more in the end then hurt us in the long run. But of course the cost of the product would be a quite big infact, maybe to big for distribution, whichcan lead to problems later on. Sure, using your mouth muscles revealing emotions is easy, but it can be a bit hard for those with stage fright or insocial status to show emotions around strangers, thats why this inventions is a great thing to me to know and have in the world of mysteries. ",
    "My claim for this story is people are trying see how are people feeling in a picture and trying to hdie thir emotions My quote from the story is \"Imagine being able to dectect exactly how other people are feelings, even when they are trying to hide their emotions.\nMona Lisa is in the picture, she 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. At some schools there are some computers sofware that can recognize emotions but not all of them. Dr. Huang is terying to find better ways for humans and computers to communicate. they are suing alot of techology to find how are people emotions in the picture. I know when people lok at a picture people wanna know how are that person is feeling in that picture.\nDr. Huang is putting the computer constructs in 3D and trying to put 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Eckman has classified six basic emotions like happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. when your in a picture your going to have some type of face expression. It all depends on what type of face that the person in the picture is looking like. Even your mouth can depend if your face expression is good or bad by tighting your lips to show anger.\nWhen your round people you can tell their face expression just by the look of their face. A lot of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy. And their face expressions can depend on how their hair looks. If their hair looks all over the place its probably bad and if their hair looks all nice its probably happy. My conclusion is to find someone feelsing is look ing at their face and their hai and how their face looks. Just like actors be doing reproduce smilling and frowning. Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions. ",
    "When we vote for our next president, do you have a voice? When you vote, you pick an \"ellectoral college\" to do the real vote. Our founding fathers decided to establish it, It's a weird system to follow though. No matter who has the popular vote, over fifty percent of the votes, will not win because of this system. I believe the people should truely decide on who becomes president, not a system When we vote, were just picking someone to vote for us again If thats true then whats the point of voting? Over 60 percent of voters now would perfer a direct election because the ones who get over fifty percent of the \"peoples\" votes seem to lose just because of this system. John F. Kennedy won from a popular vote but if the electoral system was applied then, if that happend all the great things he did would be gone. The electoral college is outdated and irrational and needs to be changed Even if we argue about the system it'll probably never change, the unfairness. Lots of people decide not to vote because of this. People are realizing that votes aren't what they seem they are anymore, people in California and Texas stopped voting because they believed their vote had no effect which is close to the truth. More and more people are not voting, the main reason is this system. If you think the electoral college is fair, think again. People might say \"oh, it's made because people who vote aren't educated enough to decide\" Are they calling the voters stupid? The only people who care to vote are the ones who mosy liekly did the research on the person before voting to make sure that person is making the right decision for our future. Oh, wait votes won't matter because the electoral college is doing it for us. The people's votes are just fake ones and dont really matter so why vote? Does the popular vote matter? Why do we still vote? The electoral college does all the work, no matter what we do. We could have over half the votes on one president and have the other one win instead. The system we have to vote is flawed and should be removed so \"we the people\" can decide who to be president. We should decide on who leads out country to success. ",
    "After much research, I have decided that the electoral college should not be kept. It is not completley fair, because the citizens think they're voting for their prefered candidate when really, they're voting for that candidate's electors. That means that if a candidate wins the votes of the citizens, he might not win the electoral college votes. This also means that he was not the president that the U.S. citizens wanted, but what the electoral voters wanted. In the article \"The Indefensible Electoral College\" they ask the question, \"Can voters sometimes controll whom their electors vote for?\" and they answer, \"Not always.\" This proves that the electoral college is not fair. Also, the electoral college shouldn't be kept because some electors will, \"refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please,\" says \"The Indifensible Electoral College\". \n \"Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" says \"The Indefensible Electoral College.\" That is more than half of the United States population, therefore we should get rid of it. I believe that we should abolish it along with that 60 percent, thatway when voting, it will be much more fair. Also, it will make choosing the president of the U.S. up to the people. Some may think that keeping the electoral college is good because, If there is a tie in the election, the electoral college can break it with their votes. Although this does help, it has only happened once, therefore proving to not be needed. Other reasons are because it gives certainty of an outcome, helps big states, and avoids run-off elections, but are also not that important. In conclusion I, along with 60 percent of the U.S. populaton, believe that the electoral college should not be kept due to its unfairness. ",
    "The idea of helping others is an important civil duty that as American children we should embrace this opportunity. The duty would and should be achieved by making community work required. Anyone can think of it as hard unneeded labor, but on the contrary community service would show students the value of helping others, give them selves moral values and will help benefit the child's future. To help a person is to show that there are people who care and are willing to spend time for your need. If it's something small or something big, the work and care put in is alike to thanking a person who has helped you in the past. The service is treating a being like the way you want to be treated. Helping someone is an experience that you can't receive online or by using your cell phone the assistants you give provide morals such as self pride. Pride can make a person feel good for what they did.

    "There are some schools that require students to continue their learning and growth through summer projects. Some teachers and students alike agree that this would be beneficial to the minds of the kids who go away for the summer and don't retain the knowledge that they've gained. Though there is some argument on who should be the ones to design them, the teachers or the students? The students should definitely have the liberty to choose and design the structure of these summer-long projects to ensure that they enjoy what they're doing while they learn. It's been proven that, when you enjoy the task at hand, you will typically receive more pride of the work you've done and more knowledge. When school lets out for the summer each year, the kids aren't worried about saving their textbooks or notes they've taken over the course of the semester. From the end of May, right up til the beginning of August, the majority of students are totally oblivious to the notion of learning. They just want to kick back and do practically nothing for those few months. As wonderful and naive as that sounds, our minds do require that we keep a little stimulation on them so they stay sharp. So rather than assigning month's worth of home-work, schools have come up with a way to keep our brains fresh, without putting so much stress on them that it causes anxiety. Projects are a more creative way to keep your knowledge in check. This way, students could spread out certain aspects of the project during the duration of summer. , this is causing problems between students and their teachers. They cannot decide who should design the projects. It's the students who are required to complete the projects, therefore they should be the ones to choose the structure of them. While teachers are worried about the material and criteria that the students have to cover, they don't really know the interests and ideas of all the kids. If you force a subject on a student that they genuinely hate for a summer long deal, they're just going to do a halfhearted job on it. For an everyday example, when\u00a0ever my Trig teacher would assign a project in class, I somewhat cared about getting it done in the beginning, but after realizing that I really don't have any level of interest in trigonometry, I just kind of stopped caring. It's very well known that when someone has an interest in a subject they will plunge all of their effort into it. If the teachers allow the students to choose their own path for the project, while still somewhat pertaining to the main subject, they would see more cooperation\u00a0from the students. As a student, I know the agony of having to go through with an assignment or project that I hated, but that was during school, during\u00a0summer, you should have some leniency. Students will typically make it more fun and add their personality when they have the opportunity to make a project their own. When they are held to so many guidelines, the projects often times look the same. there are those who say it would be more beneficial to make it the teachers' task to design them. teachers are human and don't always know what's best for their students to learn. Each person learns differently in both ways and paces. When teachers design assignments, it's, this is what your assignment is and that's that. When students do it, it becomes more unique and beneficial for each one. Also, that way students can't just copy each other's work. there is no argument that schools should require summer long projects. While teachers know what is expected of the students, they don't always really know how each child learns best. So if they were to implement the freedom for the kids to choose what they want, they would see much better results in the minds of their students. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
    "There are some schools in the country that allow and are trying to enforce Distance learning They say that it would benefit the students because they would be able to access their classes online but in reality it would only give us more stress.\n there are some families who don't have the same benefits like everyone else. Won't be able to access the internet for the online classes and yes it may sound sad, but that is the reality we are living in. There was this classmate of mine, Generic_Name, we were given an assignment online and was due the very next day but he wasnt able to do it because he didn't have internet and so the teacher blamed it on\u00a0him as if it really was his fault. Teachers are the ones wanting this because then they are just able to leave all the lesson plans online and say it due the very next day because we are able to do it at home. Kids come to school to learn, not to take everything at home and due it as if they have no life. Meanwhile, Some schools are giving kids options to go to class and or take them online. The schools like to think the best about everyone but there will be some kids using it as a way to not do anything Last class there was a student named Generic_Name and he came to English class late so he had to do the work at home and the teacher put so much trust into him just for him to go out partying and not get anything done. It is better to do things in class and in the moment we are required to do so. By schools giving the options some may take it to advantage and some might put the work in to it but it really comes down to the students and many would say to do it in class. There are already so many distraction here in school like; your friends, phones and even people walking in the halls, but the same goes for at home. Here at school you have the teachers enforcing the rules and at home its just you, so you don't really worry about till the very last second. Students should stay in class and do their work rather than taking it home and doing it there where they would get distracted so easily. High school students have been known to have the exact stress levels as a person in an insane asylum\u00a0and that is just from school work, but image if we started to bring school work home When students enter their homes that is the time they are able to relax and release stress, not gain more. People dont really like to bring this subject up but by stacking stress onto\u00a0stress is one of the main causes to suicides in high school. In high school we have take up to seven classes and that means seven the ties of stress, we take up all of our time in doing homework, sports and even work, why? because we have always been told that, you have to get a job to pay for college, you have to play a sport in high school to make friends. By doing homework, playing sports and working, no one has time to come home at like nine at night and have time to be with their families. The lack of family contact is another reasons of suicides\u00a0and the thing stopping from getting the time and contact is school and extra homework. And giving us distance learning would only make things worse. Meanwhile, giving students the ability to do things from home would be great but they would be lacking in human skills By doing everything online at home sets a wall between the teacher and student They wouldnt know life skills because you and to learn all of that in school by learning from your mistakes. Distance learning is the same as a child being home-schooled by their parents, they would only really know how to act with them and the moment they get sent out into the real world they don't know how to interact with anyone. We need human contact with each other in order to be sane. They need to learn how to trust someone and build relationships that would last a life time and they wouldn't be able to do that in their own homes. However, there are some benefits of distance learning. You are able to be out sick and not be behind in class because the teacher would just be able to send you the work. If you were to have any questions you would be able to send a message to your teacher. With the schools in the country trying to enforce distance learning may be focusing only\u00a0on the benefits, and leaving the entire well being of their students. They are thinking about how it would impact them now and not in the long run. The stress levels would increase and so would the suicide rates.\u00a0\u00a0",
    "With just one word your whole view of something could change in an instant if you listen to multiple opinions you will make better choices. It could be changed from making a tough\u00a0decision by listening to others by being open to different view by listening to more than one opinion.\n One way is multiple opinions can help tell someone the pros and cons. When you are deciding on getting something expensive someone would want to have a second opinion on that so they would go and look at review to get a better idea of if it is worth it or not. When someones deciding on doing something but cant get that one thing that will convince them enough another opinion can tip them over to see whether or not they should or should not. One opinion can dramatically change someone position. If someone feels like their opinion supports one side but then hears about somebody else opinion it could change there opinion in an instant. With that opening up to a different opinion in a hard situation can help a lot. One way that could work is if someone sees a different view you can see different experience someone had with it like if someone wanted to buy something and looked at all the reviews of that item they could have a better understanding about what there getting. Most people opinions are very valid opinions that cold persuade someone but sometimes another persons opinion could persuade them even more than the other one for example if someone is trying to get advice from someone but there advice really did not convince them well enough but then went to another Pearson who did persuade there opinion. If someone only gets one opinion then they will not really know about it enough to make a good decision. Say that someone wanted to become a lawyer but the only view they got from it was that it pays a lot but if they had gotten another view point they could have learned about the struggle of getting to that place. If people can open up to other opinions they can have a easier time to make there decisions. One way that it would be bad is that\u00a0someone might not know about the other view. If someone only listen to one opinion they will never realize about the other opinions people have that could make them have a valid decision. A viewpoint can persuade someone without them realizing the other side. If someone opinion is a strong opinion that could be the only thing that they need to be persuaded without realizing about the full thing. My last point is that only seeing one view can affect on how someone look at that one thing. If someone looks at a doctor and think that they want to be one so they can make a lot of money but never had someone else voice there opinion and tell them that its a very hard thing to accomplish than they will never realize it until it is too late for them. to close that out people should always be open to multiple opinions. having multiple opinions on something could make them have a better choice on what to pick from having an opinion on making tough\u00a0decisions, multiple opinions show different viewpoint, and only knowing one side can affect a decision in a bad way. If more people just instead of being self centered start to be open minded and have other peoples opinion flow threw there heads then there lives would change for the better.",
    "Please do not enforce the policy to not allow students to participate in extracurricular activities without a grade B average Students should be allowed to participate with at least a passing grade not all students that like to play sports and participate in other activities are able to keep a B average It would be unfair to not allow them to play because they don't have a B average. Students should be allowed to participate with at least a passing grade Some students that enjoy participating are not capable of maintaining a B average.

    "I am against the self driving car because it can crash and it would be you fault And it isn't even a self driving car because the driver still has to pur their hands on the wheel most of the time. It can't drive itself the driver has to keep their hands on the wheel almost all of the time. If you get in an accident and someone is injured it is your fault. The car won't even be made until 2020. The car will only drive itself 90 percent of the time. Some states won't even allow them to make self driving cars because they are to dangerous. Like Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. The only safe car is one with a human behind the wheel.\n Drivers would get bored just sitting there The car can only go 25mph without a human's assisstance. Human drivers have to stay more alert than ever with the car. None of the cars they make will ever be completely driverless. The cars have to alert you before they back up into something. Nobody wants a driverless car that you have to drive.",
    "In today's society, our technology has become so sophisticated to the point where we can communicate with each other halfway across the world. We're able to keep up with the times and project our thoughts and ideas to more people at the same time than ever before. Not only is technology used for communication, but it is also used to enhance learning in schools. Technology helps students access information to help them learn and allow them to do their school work even if they miss school. Today, many schools use technology for mostly everything; therefore, it is easy for schools to offer learning through online or video conferencing. schools should offer the option of learning from home some students may not feel comfortable in school, they may have to be away from school or home for an extended period of time, students can go at their own pace. Schools are notoriously known for making some students feel insecure and uncomfortable because the amount of people or the way they interact with others. Some students can be extremely introverted and not be able to work in a public environment. By offering an option to learn at home through online or video conferencing, these students may take this opportunity to be able to stay at home or an environment that they feel most comfortable in to be able to learn. Not only will this benefit the student by making them feel more safe and relaxed, but this could help them succeed more. Feeling constantly out of place and anxious in school could affect the student's learning. If given the choice to learn in their own environment of their choice, they could also be able to learn with more success as they feel comfortable. Some students don't have the choice of being able to go to school. There are many situations in which can put a family in a position to not be able to send their child to school whether it be for a short or a long period of time. During this period, if offered the ability to learn from home, students will be able to keep up with their school agenda and not miss anything. This benefits the student and also the school because the student will be able to keep learning even if they are not able to go to school and the school will be able to educate more students that will eventually be able to graduate. People may argue that schools giving the option for students to learn from home could actually be ineffective because the students would not do their work or struggle because they are not learning hands-on; however, this is not a problem because learning from home is only an option and the grading system is still in place. If the student is found failing their classes because they are not doing their work, the school can just simply not allow them to be able to have the option of learning from home again. This goes the same way for students who struggle because they are not learning in person. Learning from home is only an option, students have the choice whether or not to take it and they are able to choose for themselves what they believe is the best option for them. Online learning or video conferencing can also greatly benefit the students because they are able to go at their own pace. Without the pressure of having to catching up to other students or having to wait for other students to get the concept, students can go at whatever pace they learn at through online learning. In school, teachers have to go at a pace because they have to follow an agenda to be able to teach all the information before the end of the school year. All students also learn at different paces; some students learn quickly and grasp concepts easier while others are the exact opposite. Online learning can be especially helpful in these scenarios because students can give themselves the time they need to understand their lessons and ultimately thrive more than by learning in school. Technology has given society new opportunities and different ways of achieving goals. An example of this is by allowing students to take traditional learning in school to being able to learn at home through online and video conferencing. By giving the option for students to learn from home, students are able to benefit in many different ways as a result. Students would be able to learn in an environment they feel the most comfortable in, learn even though they can not be able to attend or be in school, and not feel pressured to go at the same pace as others. With all these factors combined, not only do the students benefit from having the choice to learn from home but they may also succeed better academically because of how much freedom is being given to the student.",
    "Now, for some people, cars are a way of life. Nothing pleases them more than the feeling of a stering wheel on their hands, or the growl of a healthy engine. Those people probably could never live without their cars, but you probably can. Well, maybe not living without cars entirely, but at least reducing your use of them. It'll be a lot safer for the environment, it'll cause a lot less traffic jams. Now, you've probably had this fact jammed down your throat more times than you care to count, but, cars produce a lot of gas, which isn't really easy on the environment.\u00a0 According to the New York Times article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50\u00a0 percent in\u00a0 some car-intensive areas in the United States.\" And according to the Chicago Tribune article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" by Robert Duffer, \"Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter.\" So, less car usage means less greenhouse emissions Yes, there are cars out there that are more \"fuel-efficient,\" but they still require lots of energy from the environment. Not only that, but using your car less often will mean that you won't have to deal with one of the biggest evils in the world.........traffic. Now, think, when have you ever been stuck in traffic and actually enjoyed it? Now, if you were to ride a bicycle or take a subway, you wouldn't have to deal with that! Already, some cities around the world are finding alternative ways to avoid those jams. \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky, tells of how the capital of Colombia is doing so. \"It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths...Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" This means you'll be able to get to work or to that first date a lot quicker! Sure, people using less cars would strike a big blow in the automobile industry, but you don't neccesarily have to never drive a car again! What about on those long road trips, or when you have to carry a lot of passengers with you? A car would come in handy in such scenarios, but not neccesarily every scenario. driving less would be more efficient because it means cleaner air and less highway congestion. So, after reading all of this information, do you think that you have what it takes to get from point A to point B without having to get into a driver's seat? can you take your hand off of the steering wheel long enough to open yourself up to other transportation options?",

    "How often do you ask for advice? Do you ask more than one person? Maybe you should. When seeking advice some people ask more than one person. It is always in your best interest to seek multiple opinions to better your final decision you want the best possible answer you don't want to make an irrational decision. For an example, you go to your \"crazy\" friend Generic_Name for advice on how to deal with something at your job. Generic_Name's advice to you is to just quit. You then go to your mom and ask for advice, her advice is to talk to your manager about it and if that doesn't work go above your manager. If you didn't go to your mom after Generic_Name you would have been without a job, but with your moms advice you have the chance to still keep your job and work the situation out. As a result, you got the best advice possible. We may not always want to go to your parent for advice, but those are the more seasoned people that can have the best advice for you. we can all be in the heat of the moment state where you just want to punch someone or something and/or cause a scene, but if you ask for advice from a person that wasn't in the situation you will get a more calm response.

    "How does the Electoral College affect the selection of the presidency and is it a positive force? Many may answer \"No.\" or \"I don't know.\" to these questions, only doing such because that's what they've been or what they've heard others say. While many have negative feelings, or no feelings at all, towards the Electoral College, it is a very useful force in electing the President because of its certainty its transregionality, and it lets \"the most thoughtful voters\" (Posner Source 3) decide the election. And in turn voters in these states will definitely receive \"the most information and attention from the candidates\" (Posner Source 2). Voters from these states at the end of the campaigns will no doubt be the most informed voters in the nation, giving them the right to decide the fate of the election for the future. While popular voting can be skewed naturally to one region or another due to their preferences and populations, the Electoral College ensures that one region can't win a campaign alone. If the President was to win due to popular vote and only because of regional appeal, \"residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised...\" (Posner Source 3) and that their president will not best represent everyone's interests. Although there was one \"fiasco\" in 2000, as Bradford Plumer calls it in Source 2, the chance of this happening is very small since \"even a very slight pulrality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.\" (Posner Source 3) For example, in 2012, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of electoral vote while he recieved only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.(Posner Source 3). A 1.3 percent from a tie is much, much more close than the 11.7 percent that that the Electoral College gives us. While some may still believe that the Electoral College is outdated and unneccesary, the usefulness of the swing states, its transregional approval system, and its certainty over popular voting proves it to be the best method of selecting our presidents for now and for the future. \u00a0 \u00a0 ",
    "The \"Face on Mars\" is a natural landform. It is not created by some aliens. If it is created by aliens, why is it the shape of human, instead of their leader, and why is it not detail enough? So I say that this \"Face on Mars\" is not created by aliens, but a natural landform.\n Some of the scientists in NASA believed that the Face was created by the aliens, so went there and took the same picture again. The image shows that it is a natural land form and there was no alien monument. But not everyone was satisfied, because the picture was taken during a cloudy time. Then we went to Mars to look for the same thing again, and it came out good. The picture was clear and detailed The 2001 picture show it is familiar to human shape but it is the shadow that makes it look more like a human mask. \nThere is a common landform on Earth that is similar to the face of human face.

    "I believe that something should be brought to your attention. I'm concerned about the way we are handling the current election process of presidency. You see, at the moment we-us Americans-use the Electoral College. But it is becoming a major issue. I understand that \"the founding fathers established it in the Constitution.\" But \"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors.\" Why focus all of our time choosing Electors, when we could be allowing citizens to vote directly for their President themselves. Office of the Federal Register states,\"The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors.\" Did you realize that \"a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President\"? We have millions of people in our country that could be doing the work themselves. I understand that life is not always fair, but I do believe that as a State Senator you could use a hand. \"The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.\" They could use a helping hand as well! \"The presidential election is held every four years.\" In those four years, American citizens wait eagerly and anxiously to choose a potential new president. Why don't we give the people what they want? \"Most states have a 'winner-takes-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of 'proportional representation.'\" These complications could be avoided if we listened to what the citizens have to say and allowed them the freedom to vote for their president directly. America is the land of freedom after all, \"According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" A recent article by Bradford Plumer says,\"It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.\" Rather than worrying about \"certainty of outcome\", \"everyone's president\", \"swing states\", \"big states\", and \"avoiding run-off elections\", why not just let our beloved, fortunate, intelligent American citizens be happy and choose who they would prefer run their life?

    "It's the last day of school, and students are sweating bullets eager for the clock to kick off their summer vacation when the hour-hand strikes two. Suddenly, collective groans echo throughout the entire school when an english teacher hands out a summer reading project. Many schools require students to complete some kind of assignment during their summer break because the school boards believe that it will ensure continued learning. Summer assignments usually ask that students read a book over the summer and fill out some type of summary or chart. Many students have great disdain for summer projects because they can act as a looming annoyance waiting to be accomplished. Summer projects should be student-designed it gives students the ability to work at their own pace, promotes interest prevents students from copying eachother Allowing students to design their own summer project allows them to work at their own pace. Schools usually don't account for what home or family students go back to during the summer. A student might go back to a family with elderly or children they have to take care of thus filling up their schedule. Schools also don't account for students who have jobs during the summer. If a teacher assigns a project that consists of several pages of charts, summaries, or questions to fill out, it can slam a ton of stress on students going home to a busy schedule. Giving students the ability to design their own projects benefits students who will be busy over summer break because they can reserve whatever time they can scrap up for making a project that makes their life easier. Although not encouraged, this freedom also gives students who procrastinate the ability to make their sleepless night completing said project the day before school starts less stressful Since every student is different, every student benefits with the power to work at their own pace. Giving students the freedom to design their own summer project also promotes interest in the assignment. For typical summer projects like reading a book, students are usually given a reading list of books and they're required to read one of the books on the list. The lists arguably always consist of books that students find boring or repetitive when they go over topics they've already studied in the past. Students won't be interested in works they find boring or repetitive so when they're making a project off of it, words, reasoning, and justification will seem empty and made up on the spot. If students are allowed to pick any book they'd like to read over the summer and make an assignment off of it, their interest and passion might shine through in their interpretation of the material. Some might say that assignments students make up could be counterproductive since they might not have anything to do with themes or topics that will be learned in the coming school year. On the other hand, teachers can simply just note as a minor requirement that students must make one quick connection from their project to any theme that will be studied in the school year. Letting students design their own summer projects also prevents them from copying one another. One tactic that students will typically use with summer projects like reading a book of their choice and filling out the same chart is to read the same book as a friend and then copy each other\u00a0answers when they have to turn the project in. If students design their own project, they'll have to show some individuality and creativity on the due date. Teachers will have an easier time telling when students copy each other\u00a0because if done right, no student should have created the same project. If two students are caught clearly copying off each other\u00a0on a project meant for individuality, they can be punished accordingly. Everyone will turn something different in at least some way when they aren't spoon fed\u00a0a big packet and instead get to create their own packet. Overall, both students and teachers benefit when students are the ones who make the summer project because students work at their own pace, create something they might be interested in, and display their individuality in learning more accurately. Students who procrastinate, have jobs, or take care of family over the summer will heave a sigh of relief. Students will be grateful they'll have a more creative, individual project to complete when they're bored during the summer and not a big, scary one that's due the day they get back to school. Less groans will echo throughout schools when students hear that they have more freedom in an assignment given for what's supposed to be a break.\u00a0 ",
    "Next year, Generic_City will be offering a new online program to all schools. Students will have access to their classes online while still being enrolled in school. They will not be required to take part in their online classes, however they will be provided with it whenever they will not be present in school. Due to this online program, Generic_Name's parents are considering on home schooling him, in belief that this new program would allow him to skip school. Generic_Name, on the other hand, thinks that this online program would be beneficial for him and is hoping to convince his parents to let him stay. Students, like Generic_Name, would benefit from being able to attend school from home it can help them stay on track it is adjustable to diverse lifestyles. Attending classes from home can help students stay on track in school Due to Generic_Name's low immune system, he often misses school because he is always getting sick. With this new online program, Generic_Name can have access to the material he would be missing in class from home. Therefore, he would not have loads of assignements waiting for him by the time he gets back. Although some may argue that students should take the time to rest at home instead of working on assignments while they are sick, being able to work on a few homework assignments rather than attending all classes at school will keep them from falling behind as they are resting for most of the day. Following Generic_Name's frequent absences, students in Generic_City often miss school as well due to snow days during the winter. Now that students can access their assignments at home in snow days, teachers would not feel as rushed to teach them everything before the semester ends. Students that have illnesses and live in areas of inclement weather can benefit from online schooling by keeping up with new material in their classes. Students can adjust their education to their different lifestyles by being able to attend classes outside of school. Generic_Name is a well known, famous musician who flies out to Los Angeles multiple times a year to work with other artists. With a busy lifestyle like his, online classes would be more flexible in fiiting into his schedule whenever he is out in Los Angeles pursuing his music career. While it is recommended for him to take school online as a whole instead, Generic_Name wants to keep his life as normal as possible by attending school with his friends as often as he can Another reason why this new program would be beneficial for Generic_Name is because of his parents being divorced. Every couple of months, he likes to visit his dad, who lives outside of Generic_City, for a week. With him being out of school for a short while, he can easily work on his assignments at his dad's house without worrying about the material he would have missed. Students living different lifestyles will benefit from being able to attend classes online. Although some people, like Generic_Name's parents, believe that schools offering students to attend classes from home will keep them from comimg to school it can actually be beneficial in preventing them from falling behind and by it being easily adjusted into diverse lifestyles. Therefore, sick days and school closings due to inclement weather will not be set backs anymore. Also, students living at one parent's home to another will not have to worry as well as the students with already developing careers. With Generic_Name's reasonings on why this new online program would be beneficial for him and his music career, he was able to convince his parents to let him stay at his school in Generic_City and is now enjoying his life as a normal teen with a passion for music.",
    "Communication has progressed from the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 to the endless communication that is now available in the 21st century it has come at a price. People's need for communication, specifically with cell-phones has created the serious issue of cell-phone use while driving. This issue leads to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving. This issue has caused various accidents and sometimes deaths. The distraction that cell-phones create while driving has the ability to seriously injure or even take someone's life away. For many years, while most states have not had laws regulating cell-phone use while driving, there have been various PSA campaigns warning against cell-phone use while driving, usually specific with texting and driving. These PSAs are meant to scare drivers hoping that it will discourage this dangerous behavior.\n These distracted drivers are usually texting to reply to someone, using their satellite navigation system on their phone, or could be adjusting their music through their phone. These behaviors have been specifically targeted by many states that have enacted laws to prevent cell-phone use that can cause accidents. Georgia, specifically, passed the hands-free rule, fining drivers for cell-phone use, holding the phone. This law can be easily obeyed because of the adjustments created by car companies and other accessories that are available. More recent cars have options for phones through the car to keep the driver focused on the road but keeping the communication possible for the driver. Cars may have an aux cord or a bluetooth option to be able to receive and make calls without touching the phone. Phones connected to the car this way, can play music through a cell-phone through the car, then the driver can control volume and choice of song through the steering wheel. There are many car accessories to make phone use safer like an attachment to the windshield that holds the driver's phone, to keep their eyes in the front to the road rather than to the side to look at their phone. These adjustments that coincide with laws like the hands-free rule allow drivers to safely use their cell-phones while driving. This issue has lead to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving, but will continue to have serious consequences. While there are many solutions to this issue have been created it will still have consequences. People will continue to be injured or killed by this issue but without any restrictions or inventions this issue would not continued at the same rate. The precautions keep the roads as safe as they can be, because people will continue to use their cell-phones while driving, but at least it is more regulated and less distracting now",

    "A friend once said to me that summer is a giant break for us students to relax and recover from the stress of school. Some schools do require summer based projects during the break to keep us learning though. Sometimes these projects are teacher based or even student based. Teachers however, should not be designing summer based projects Summer based projects should be student designed students are more likely to enjoy them it gives the students a chance to take action, it helps give teachers insight on what they could do better. If students design the summer projects, they are more likely to enjoy and be more invested in them. One time in summer school, I was in a class where we were solving a mystery. The mystery however, was left open ended and did not really have an ending. I remember all my classmates being really upset. If students were involved in the creation of this activity, they could have made it have a more meaningful ending as to what students might have wanted. Summer based projects should be fun for the students. They should be able to enjoy them without having to stress too much over them. Students are going to likely be more\u00a0interested in the project if they create it themselves. Students might feel limited otherwise as to what they can do if it were a PowerPoint for example. There was a time where I wanted to do a drawing for a summer project, but my idea was rejected. I did not have as much fun with my project than I would have with my drawing. teachers could benefit and learn how to improve summer projects. Teachers often design he majority of what we do whether it be lessons, notes or even projects. Teachers could learn and observe how we may want to do the projects. My mom is a high school teacher and she often asks me for advice as to what might help students not just learn, but also have fun or not hate school even. Teachers could give out monthly surveys as a way to help them gain feedback. Summer projects could work in a similar fashion. Teachers should also give students more independence and time to work on large projects. Maybe some students in the past could have enjoyed school or summer projects more if they were student based. In the future, students should take the initiative and design more summer projects. Students should do this so they can get the most out of their learning. There might be some adults who say that students are just going to take advantage of them designing the projects and be lazy with it. However, students should learn how to do this kind of project based planning. It will help them be more independent and creative. Students should design summer projects so they can more likely enjoy them, help give teachers advice as to what they could improve, and it can help students mature.",
    "Some students with severe cases of disabilities cannot attend school on a daily basis, sometimes missing school for up to weeks at a time. These students usually end up either dropping out of school or repeating grades, which could not only ruin their chances of going to college and getting a job, but their mental health as well because some of these children have dream jobs and goals that they desire to achieve and may realize that their absence from school will prevent them from obtaining their dreams. All of this adds up to what could be another disability that would further prevent the student from coming to school. Even though it would be better if students went to school and were educated in person, many students would actually benefit very much from attending classes at home. For example, my sister was diagnosed with severe anxiety at a young age, and about a year ago, her anxiety interfered with her daily life so much that she had to go to mental hospitals to get proper treatment. To this day, she spends her life at a mental institution and has not attended school for a long time. Fortunately, the hospital she is at right now offers an education system where she can take classes that real schools offer; however, she fears that she will have to repeat freshman year of high school because, so far, she has been absent every single day this year and frets that she will have to be held back, adding on to her anxiety. My sister, and students just like her, would absolutely benefit from video conferences with teachers and online school. However, virtual school could work beyond people with disabilities: it could also benefit sick students, children who are moving, students going to schools that are under renovation, and kids who simply missed the bus. Even though creating programs like this could be very expensive and teachers may have to work extra time it would be worth it for lots of school systems around the world There would be a high chance that graduation rates would rise, there would be no excuse for being absent, and many students with disabilities will finally be able to achieve their dreams and have the future they want.",
    "Some schools assign summer projects for students to finish before the next school year comes around. The purpose of this work is to push the student to grow and learn on their own time. For example, teachers give book assignments where the student must read, then write an essay about the book. The topic of the summer project may be interesting to some, but cause other students to hate the work. Teacher designed summer projects should not be permitted and forced onto students. teachers don't know if the topic they chose will interest everybody. Students know what they themselves enjoy, so why force them to do somehting they may hate. When\u00a0teachers\u00a0assign summer projects its\u00a0interrupts, and steals, the\u00a0break that students need and deserve over the summer. If the project were chosen by the student then the subject would be something of their interest, and the project wouldn't be seen as such a nuisance. A students main priority during the summer should be to have fun. If a student enjoys the topic that they chose for their project then it wouldn't be interrupting the break, they well deserve, it would just be adding to it. For example, instead of reading, \"Lord of the Flies,\" students should be able to pick a book on a topic they as an individual enjoy. students dont have the time or energy for it. Students who were just learning how to write essays a few years back are now getting jobs and paying bills. Those students, society believes to be little children, are now working twelve hour shifts. As a student, with a job and bills to pay, work is very consuming of not only time but also energy. If a student does not have the time or energy for the project then nothing will get done. But if a student is allowed to pick their own topic then they will make time for it. People make time for things they like, for example, intimate relationships, sports, and friends. Student-designed summer projects would encourage the student to do finish their work, knowing that its something they enjoy. Although some believe that if the summer project is student-designed then they wont learn anything or grow, they are wrong. No mater what topic or subject is chosen\u00a0for the summer project, or for anything in life, there is always something more that a person could learn and gain from it. Students know what they like, so they can chose the topic but in the end its still a project and its something the students must put work and thought into, pushing them to grow. When the project is student-designed the person doing the project would have more motive to finish the project well and learn even more on the topic, than if a teacher designed the project. Having the students interest in a summer project could make them want to learn more, instead of forcing them into more stress. Each student is unique and likes different things. Schools should stop pushing them complete things that they dont like or understand. One way schools could fix this is by assigning a paper two months before the end of the school year asking for a detailed explanation of what the student wants to do for their summer project. The school or teachers could pick the way that they want the project ot be done but allow the student to chose the topic. By letting them chose the topic of the summer project it would help the students feel less stress and allow them to enjoy their summer while continuing to learn and grow.\u00a0",
    "Activities for Everyone!\nNow everybody will have something to do!\nThe principal just decided that every student must take part in an activity, before school, after school or even during school! This new, amazing and creative idea will be beneficial to everyone! Not only the students, but the entire school administration including the teachers! Even parents will profit from the outstanding new idea! After this decision starts getting enforced, every student will be able to find something they like! \n Possibilities range from participating in sports to serving on the student council or helping to create the school yearbook! Students are very likely to find new friends while they participate in these activities and probably even run into some old ones! Having friends in their activity will surely motivate them to do better and achieve their goal! Meeting those new people and having that special diversity will bring lots of students together and form unimaginable new bonds, friendships and relationships. Students struggling with their social life and stressing school days will finally have something to look forward to! The sport activities will also greatly improve ones understanding and overall skill in said sport. Joining sports teams will set a positive example for students and be a healthy and rewarding getaway from anything that might be bothering them. Working on the yearbook is an overall exciting experience that involves montages,photo shop\u00a0and other activities! Students will be able to have fun and help the school at the same time! Student Council is also a splendid decision and it\u00a0will show a student how many real life companies work, Students will be given more responsibility and trust. Both student council and yearbook editor have much in common and both contribute to help shape a young adults future life by polishing their skills, interests and hobbies. After school parents might still be working or just have too much on their hands to care for their children, This is where these extracurricular activities will also come in handy because students will be supervised, be constructive and have fun at the same time! Overall these activities would be a great getaway for every student! Activities will include creative and challenging brain usage to athleticism. Students will be taken care of and supervised while they help out themselves and the school. Sports will be healthy and inspiring for the young kids and put a positive example for what they can do in the future. These activities will remodel the students interests and hand over many new possibilities! ",

    "Did you have to do a project over\u00a0the summer for school? If so that assignment was called a summer learning project and it's used to make sure students are learning over summer break. Although some might argue that the project should be student-designed, it should be a teacher-designed. Students being able to design their own summer projects would not make the project a leaning experience. A student would do the project on a topic that he/she already knows about instead of leaning something new because he/she would want to hurry up and go outside to enjoy the summer. For example, if a student already knows about the great depression\u00a0and has to do a project on the topic about devastating things that has happened to the American economy\u00a0he/she would write about the great depression because they already\u00a0know what happened. There would be no need to go the library or research anything or learn something new. Teachers pick projects that will challenge his or her students to excel not only in the specific subject that he/she teaches but in life also. Teachers assign projects that will help their students do better in his or her class. English teachers will\u00a0assign\u00a0a student a book to read that will have a theme\u00a0that will be talked about throughout the entire year. Which allows students to be prepared in class and even do better in class because of the knowledge that they have gained by doing the project. Students will already have some insight on what the teacher expects and how they run their classroom based on the summer reading project. \n Teachers pick projects that keep students up to date on what's happening in society. Government teachers assign\u00a0summer project that help students learn laws that can keep them safe and away from prison and also help save others. It also\u00a0helps them learn about their state Governor and how they are helping the people in the city that\u00a0they live in and how they can help bring about change to things that they might not like. Teacher based projects keep students connected with the outside world. Teachers should also pick the summer projects because it teachers student how to follow directions and how to be independent. It helps students learn how to only rely on themselves and not anyone else because you can not ask the teacher for help. The student has to learn\u00a0how to do it\u00a0themselves which is\u00a0a skill everyone needs, it also teaches students how to follow directions, teacher gives out a rubric and the students must follow the rubric to get a good grade. If each\u00a0student\u00a0designed\u00a0their\u00a0own project each project would be\u00a0different\u00a0which would be\u00a0thought\u00a0for the\u00a0teacher\u00a0to grade and come up with a\u00a0rubric\u00a0for. Teachers should pick the summer reading because they only want what's best for their students. It helps them: learn,stay connected with the world, learn independence, and be an overall great student. If teachers keep picking the summer projects future\u00a0students will become the important hard working men and women that will eventually run the world. ",
    "I don't like how the students have to pick what they what to do what if they don't what to do noting and I feel like they are getting focus to do something they don't what to do. But some kids would like it because they like sports or to work on the yearbook for the school or take serve on the student council. But the other student they dont like to do any of that but they are being focus to do stuff. The principal should not focus the kids to do something they don't what to do the principal should ask if they what to do it or not. Because that is more stuff that they got to do and it is not fair on them. And the kids are not going to like there principal no more because the principal is making them do stuff that they don't what to do. And I feel like they should have freedom. \n I disagree.\u00a0 ",
    "Cars are the main cause of pollution in major cities. Cities are covered in smog from gas emmisions from a car's exhaust. This is not good for the environment. Something must be done about this. If the usage of cars is cut down, then the amout of pollution in the air will be less. A less usage of cars allows people to have a clean community and helps the environment. \nIn Germany, there is a small community that is completely car-free. This community, Vauban, has about 5,500 residents, and not a single one of them use a car This community is very clean and all of the people that live there are happy . Just think, what if every family in Vauban had a car? It would completely change this happy, clean community. There would be a lot more pollution and more stressful citizens. More and more small towns are beginning to ditch the cars for walking and taking a bicycle.\n More cities are starting to have car-free days to help with the pollution problems that are caused\u00a0by automobile engines. Examples of these cities include Paris, France and Bogota, Colombia. Pollution is starting to be a big problem in big cities like these, so they have decided to take action. Pollution is destroying our atmosphere. The gases that are released from the exhaust of car engines slowly deteriorates the layer of atmosphere of our world.\u00a0If cars begin to be frequently used like they are now, the atmosphere may become damaged beyond the condition for being fixed. Earth only has one atmosphere, so once it's gone, we can't get it back. People in the United States are beginning to cut back on the number of people who drive cars. The U.S. has been one of the leading country with the number of people who drive cars and the amount of pollution, but people have been taking action and going for a greener alternative. In the fourth passage it says, \"A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.\" A lot of people between 16 and 39 do not even have a driver's license. People are starting to take public transportation and carpool instead of driving their vehicles from point A to point B. With more and more people doing this, it just lessens the amount of emmisions in the atmsophere more. America has passed it prime for driving because of the more and more who are taking action in making a change in the health of our world. there are many reasons that we should start to lessen the amount of people driving on the road. It just causes pollution and makes the health and well- being of others and the earth worse. People are already beginning to make a change, but we need more than there is to make a difference. \u00a0",
    "The two policies that you have considered are to help the students at this school focus during the duration of the school day. One policy may work better for certain things, and another may work well also. In my opinion, the policy that would be most beneficial to the school system and students would be the first one, \"Allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.\". Having cell phones during class periods can be a huge distraction to kids, and can harm their grades as well as their future. They would not be allowed to have cell phones at all during school, and at times when they are not studying or learning, they may actually have to use their cell phones. For example, if a sudden storm of snow or rain cancels an after-school activity, and the student does not have any way of transportation to get home, then the student would have to go through a lot of trouble just to find someone who has a phone or a way of getting home. The first policy allows students to have cell phones out during times when they are not studying or learning, and would be very useful for the kids. In the situation described earlier, the student would just be able to take out their cell phone and turn it on, then call their parent or guardian to take them home. The situation would become much easier. The student's learning habits would not be harmed either, as long as they follow the rules and do not turn their cell phone on during class. If they do happen to have their cell phone on during class, then certain punishments may be necessary for the kids to not do this again. One punishment may be to temporarily take away the cell phone or reduce their grade in that class. There are even more situations that this policy could be useful in as well. If a student has an emergency with no way of getting to a phone, then the student could just take out their mobile phone and call whoever they have to. In this situation, the mobile phone could be a huge help or even a life-saver. I hope that you will consider the ideas I have presented during this document, and may take them into action, so that one day the school system will have a fair way of controlling the kids' cell phone habits during school hours.",
    "I think that students should participate in sports and activities students should at least have a B or C average in a sport. So that what ever sport they play they can still be in it. We can see what the students think about it to see if they would what the policy change or not they probably think if they liked it change or they don't liked it changed to have least have a B average to participate in sports or other activities. I think some of the students would liked the change and some of the others students probably like about the change of the policy that might be possible to change. I have no idea what they would think about the change to the policy that might be possible to be changing when you can only participate in sports or other activities like clubs and all the other stuff. My friend of mine told me she has a C average in one class and the rest she has like a B average she think she does. She also told me if it does change she would say she don't like the policy being changed. Because she said some students wont liked it any way. She bets some would at least like the idea of changed it to have least a B average. My other friends of mine don't want it to change. I agree with them about it possible about it being changed. I think some people would like the change so that way they can get better grades so they can also go to the next grade that way they can go to college and live their dr ",
    "Dear senator of Florida. I am here today to tell you what I think about the Electoral College. I think the the Electoral College is a very irrational way to elect our presidents of the untied states of America. It might have been effective when it was first created, but now it dosent seem like it can work out anymore. \nWell for starters, under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This was stated by Bradford plumer in his article : The indefensible Electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong This is not fair to the citizens. They should be alowed to vote for whatever president they want, instead of letting a bunch of electors \"pledged\" to the candidates vote for them \nPlumer also writes : \"Can voters control whom their elctors vote for? Not always.\" What does this mean? It means that the times when they can\"t control them, they could be using the citizens vote to vote for other Candidates other than the ones they are supposed to be pledged to . It's not fair that sometimes citizens can't control who their elctors vote for. This shows that this great \"system\" is starting to fall Apart. \"Do voters sometimes get cofused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\" This is why the Electoral College needs to be abolished. The electors put on a facade and allow the voters to become confused. This allows them to easily fall into the trap. Its like trying to show a blind man a picture. You must give details about it in order to create a picture for him to follow. This is what is going on with the voters. The electors sometimes gove them false information to follow, allowing them to vote for the wrong candidate. In an article written by Richard A. Posner called: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing our President, He states That the advocates are correct in aurguinng that the Electoral College is not democratic in a modern sense. Even an article that is supposed to support keeping the Electoral College says that it is not democratic. the Electoral Collge is not democratic at all. \nIn Plumers article, he talks about the time a state sent two slates of electors to congress. It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent's electors, but he made sure to do so \"without establlishing a precendent.\". He finishes that section by asking: what if it happened again? This was not just a small little mistake that happened. That was a big problem that could have changed everything The Electoral College Has to many flaws to keep running and this was one of them. America was meant to become a democracy, and if we keep the colleg, it will always keep us from becoming it. I agree that the Electoral College was one of the best Sytems created. Unfourtunatley, not everything was meant to work out in the long run. Jobs, careers, school, buisnesses, relationships, and the Electoral College. It has made vital mistakes that has caused us not to be able to have much faith in it anymore. It was good in the begining, but now its time for it to come to an end. ",
    "As time progresses, technology becomes even more of an evident and essential apart of our everyday lives. Society is moving toward an almost completely digital lifestyles, causing the youth to become even more involved in phones, computers, and etc. Although this ongoing innovation is an improvement, it also has made its case as a potential hazard to today's generation. Specifically, when combining the machinery of vehicles, which are capable of killing passengers at personality of cellphones, the result is fatal disaster Basically, while cellphones are helpful technology, drivers should rarely or never use them when operating any vehicle. Primarily, as the number of people using cell phones while driving will also increase on streets and highways. At the same time rate, drivers still talk on cell phones and send text messages while driving. They will also engaging in other activities apart from driving. For example, drives will text when driving, and they will dial numbers. Drivers will also receive calls and talk on their devices for long periods of time. Again, driving demands your full attention, and your concentration which is taken away when talking on the phone it means that the driver has to divert his attention to the conversation, which leads to less concentration on the road. All in all, one can connect accidents and cell phone usage while driving to this very diversion of attention.\n Furthermore, drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Ad a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. This puts both drivers and even pedestrians in harm's way.",
    "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These projects range from all sorts of different styles and designs. Some people argue that these assignments should be teacher-designed so it is more detailed and challenging. Others argue that it should be student-designed so its better for the student Summer projects should be student-designed students will learn better from it, students will be more passionate about it teacher-designed projects take away freedom. People learn better when they do things themselves. If students have the ability to choose how to do their project, then they can learn from their mistakes. Mistakes are the best way to learn which makes student-designed projects the best way to learn. Furthermore, its helps students overcome obstacles. When students are doing their projects they will run into troubles. If the project is student-designed, they will have to overcome these obstacles themselves and help them grow academically. To sum it up, student-designed projects help students learn from mistakes and help them overcome obstacles. Students will do their project if they can choose what its on. If students can choose the subject of the project they will be more likely to do it because they are interested in what it is about. If the project is something they do not care about, they will not complete the assignment. Students will have more fun doing the project. If students can choose the subject of the project they will likely choose something they are interested in. If the subject of the project is something the student enjoys, they will have a great time doing it. To sum it up, student-designed projects will encourage students to complete the assignments and students will have a good time doing it. Teacher's get to choose everything. Teacher's get to choose what assignments students receive throughout the whole school year. Students should get the chance to be free and choose what they want. Furthermore, Students should get the choice of how the project gets done. Students have to take time out of their vacation to complete their summer project. Since they're using their own time, they should at least get to decide how to do their project. To sum it up, student-designed projects give students the freedom to learn what they want to learn. Student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed projects because they help students learn better by making them overcome obstacles. Students are also more passionate about it and it gives them the freedom to do what they want. Students don't get the chance to choose many things, but summer projects should be something they get to complete the way they want.",
    "Every day millions of children come home on a bus instead of staying after school, and for many, there is a very good reason. It seems to make sense, having everyone take a extra curricular activity, but in reality it doesn't work. Every student has a reason to go, or not to go to an extra curricular activity and some reasons are not just because of preference. Not everyone has a lifestyle that allows them to stay after school or do a sport, many of the students won't have a way to get home. The school will not be able to provide enough buses for these students either. There isn't even enough room in the current activity rooms to hold 78 kids, and the materials needed are to expensive. Having mandatory extra curricular\u00a0activities will be a disaster there is not enough room, it is to expensive students won't be able to get home. If our school system made extra curricular activities mandatory the first problem would be the amount of space needed to support the students activity. For example, there are almost 900 students in my school, This would mean in the 10 after school activities my school provides, there would need to be 90 kids in each one; That's enough to fill 4 classrooms. This brings up another problem, the school can't have 150 kids in one program and 10 in the other, so the school would have to chose the activity for us. Just that fact alone takes all the excitement out of the activity, just for reference, imagine the star quarter back on the football ending up in art instead, possibly destroying his or her whole football career. Most of my school's after school\u00a0activities need certain spaces for the participants to practice and do their activity. For instance the robotics team only has one room with all of the vices, saws, and tools while the other robotics rooms will have students constantly running between the other rooms getting tools that they dont have in their completely different room. The cheer leading\u00a0team will have to move to the gym to fit all the people, but so did the pep band, and basketball practice is already in the gym, but they could just go in the auxiliary gym which is smaller than the cafeteria, the problem with that is the wrestling team is already in the auxiliary gym. The school has no room to fit every team and all of the clubs. A dungeons and Dragons game along with all of the books and die is over 200 dollars, now imagining multiplying that by 7 just to afford the basics for the club. The robotics team pays around 600 dollars for each robot, and more for the competitions, now that program has to buy 15 robots and buy more slots at the competitions. If some how the schools were able to afford these expensive along with all other clubs, teachers, and staff salaries it would come from our local taxes. This would double our local taxes, but if the schools decide not to over tax the citizens of Generic_School than there would be no way the school could provide the gear and equipment for the school's clubs and teams. My school's sports gear is already worn out and our schools are in dire need of new equipment, but there is no way we could spend 7 times as much just to give everyone more cheap and basic equipment. On most days my dad gets home at around six so when my activity ends at 4:30 in the afternoon i have to take the bus. Currently my school has 2 activity buses, one for Generic_City and one for Generic_City. The activity bus arrives at my home which is 5 miles away at 5:40 in the evening, it takes the bus 1 hour and 10 minutes to drop me off at my home. With a direct route the bus would have to travel at 4 mph. There is no way the school can hire enough buses to work almost 12 straight hours a day. If the school really can't find enough buses each bus would have to make 70 stops. Many students won't be able to be picked up by their parents and will be forced to endure the 3 hour bus ride through a city with only 30 square miles of residential area.\n If our schools really made after school activities mandatory, it would be a disaster. One of the biggest issues with this topic is that in its simple form it looks like a great idea, but when you look at the details and what it would cause it shows the big mistake it would be. Giving every student the chance to do an interactive activity they enjoy would be incredible. Sadly, doing that in our current school system would cause all after school activities to stop going to competitions due to the over crowding; The students would not be able to pick their own activity and would be forced to do something they are bad at or just dislike. Making the activities would not only be a punishment to the students of Generic_School but to the teachers, the bus drivers, the custodians, the administrators, the taxpayers, and even our entire county's well being. In this scenario it may at first look like everybody wins, but really when you look at the real facts everybody loses. The entire mentality of school will become even more negative as students are stripped of their choice to do something they enjoy and taken away from time with their family. Although the goal of this rule would be to create a good learning environment and a chance to participate in more interactive learning experiences, our county administrators might fail to see the real outcome of this decision.

    "The choice of who becomes president should be left to the Electoral College. The people are the ones who vote for slate electors and the outcome is fair. This is why the decision of who becomes president shdould be left for the Electoral College to decide. The first reason why deciding the president should be left to the Electoral College is because the slate electors are voted on by the people Each party chooses a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. There is the possibility that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the popular vote. Even though that happens very rarely. Voters are needed when choosing slate electors because a single persons vote may effect who is chosen fo the position. The Electoral College is decided on by voters and wheather or not someone votes may change who becomes the slate elector for your state. Another reason the Electoral College shuld remain is because the outcome of the vote is fair to voters. A presidential candidate, required by the Electoral College, is to have a trans-regional appeal so that if he or she is favored by one region the residents of the other regions do not feel as though their votes do not count. The weight in the political balance that large states lose is restored by the Electoral College.\u00a0 Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign and are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\n The decision over who becomes president should be for the Electoral College. The Electoral College is chosen by the voters of each state and has the larger chance of the outcome being fair. The people choose their slate electors and trust them with voting for the party's nominee. these are reasons why the Electoral College should be the deciding factor on who does and does not become our new president.

    "Well on my opinion I don't think the face is a natural landform, in the text it states- twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. If the face has been apart of Mars for ONLY twenty five years I don't think is was apart of martian life, it would've already been discovered a long time ago. I honestly think it has been made up by an illusion. Stated in paragraph three, NASA uveiled the image for all to see, it was a huge rock formation, which resmebled an humans head making out the shaped of nose, eyes, and mouth. They thought reasoning this situation of Mars would be a great way to grab the public's attention to Mars. It did. Ever since then it has became an pop icon, so now that i think about it, It does'nt seem like it was apart of martian life. They so far haven't even caught real martian life on planet Mars. So I don't even know how to think that NASA could determine it was apart of alien life on Mars. It possibly could be but I don't think anything could live on the surface of that COLD planet. It puzzles me that it just randomly popped up out of nowhere and has been located at that very spot for twenty five years, why could this happen now? I don't know maybe later in discovery the scientists of NASA will find out what and why this happened. NASA's budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. I guess we'll have to find out later in the future. The \"Face on Mars\" has been starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, articles, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines! Now you know why people are so amazed of being able to read about this story and give NASA so much feedbacks about this \"Face on Mars\" story. One day they'll determine what'll happen. ",
    "Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I believe that is a good option, and students would benefit being able to attend classes from home Many teenager can have good benefits from taking classes from home Today many students can not assist to the school because the transportation, they have appointment that they have to assist.\n First, I think that is good option for students to attend classes from home, because some students do not have transportation .For example, i have a friend that she can not study because her way to the school is very long and she do not have transportation and she do not have someone who came take her to the school because her family do not have a car .If she could have the opportunity to have class from home will be a good benefit for her,because she would\u00a0like to finish her high school. Also, many student miss classes because they have to work ,or they have appointments and they can not assist to their classes. When students miss classes ,they will be affected latter for their test or quiz\u00a0.For example, last week i did not went to the school because i have a doctor appointment ,and when i went the next day i was affected because i took a quiz and i did not recover the class that i missed But if students\u00a0could take classes online the day that they can not assist to the school will be good because they will be not affected because they will have the opportunity to recover the class. In conclusion, offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home online or video conference is a good option,because it will give a lot of benefits to many students who can no attend schools. It will be more easy to students who can not assist to their classes and they will no be affected on their grades,because students who miss one day can be affected a lot on their grades.",
    "My opinion i believe that we the students should be able to have are phones at school. I think that they should be shut of during the classes , but however at lunch the students should be aloud to use them to call parents for emergency uses. The students have the right to bring there cell phones to school it is not hurting anybody. i could understand why you are considering making the policy so that we can not have are cell phones , in some cases you may think that it is interfering with our learning but most of the students will be responsible and keep there phone in there back packs turned off. Most of the students have to walk to and from school and some live in bad parts of town so there parents have them when they call when they get to school or when they leave from school. There are many other purposes why students need to have there cell phones at school, but these are just the ones that i felt were most important.\n",
    "Limiting car usage is a discrase Why stop making cars when thats what we need the most in this world, with out a car we cant go no where. What they should do is cut down the price to a lower price cause not everyone in this world is a multi millioner.

    "In our third world era, people have lots of personal problems. Most of the time, they get too difficult for us to solve them by ourselves, so we search for advice from others. It's intelligent to ask for advice, however, people should never settle for less and only ask one person. People should always talk to more than one person, for contradicting point of views more solutions, more reliable people. Listening to more than one person for advice will give the opportunity to hear different opinions. It's a good thing to be open mined, and listen to there point of view because people will most likely see there problem in a different way. They might even see there issue as not as big of a problem anymore, or that there issue is easy to solve, now that they're looking at it in a different way. Which will help them in the future when they have bigger problems. Going to a person for solutions to a problem, and then getting the same advice they told themselves, isn't going to help them at all. Seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice. People need those contradicting mindsets in order for us to see the problem clearer. Asking for advice gives people ideas, and then they act on them. Though sometimes the idea doesn't work out.\nThat is why people need to ask multiple people for advice. There will be a higher chance that they will find the solution they need. Even if someone asked more than one person for advice and still they didn't get what they need, they could take the ideas they got and piece them together. Asking for more advice would never hurt anyone, but instead help people locate more ideas and more solutions. As people ask for advice, they tend to speak to people who don't know how to give good advice, that is something they should avoid. Talking to multiple people will give others more information and good advice. People should also talk to professionals for better advice. They should try to talk to more than one because others may give better information for them or have a different mindset. It makes a significant improvement for finding better advice. Searching for more advice is always beneficial, and it helps people understand there issue better. It's very unlikely for someone to get the advice they need on there first try, and most people dwell on the only advice they get, so it is important to always ask more people. First, people will find more solutions and come up with more ideas. They will also understand the issue clearer when listening too more opinions. Finally, if you speak to more people, you will find people with more experience and factual opinions. Searching for more advice will always help you, so don't miss out on the opportunity of finding better advice. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ",

    "People all over the world have died due to people using there phone while driving to justify that its alright for people to use their phone while driving is wrong people should learn that when your going about 80 in a rolling death box the last thing you need to look at Is your phone. Just a little over 4000 people in 2018 died or caused death while they were using their phone and driving that may seem like a small number, but those crashes caused at least $129 billion or 15% of over all societal damage. Driving while on the phone is and should stay illegal it'll cause less death every year and accidents in general, god knows we need to stop having manmade disasters. I feel as if they need to make the law stricter though so people actually learn to stop texting and driving, put them in jail for 5 days or something like that it will for sure make them never want to text and drive again.

    "I have heard about your change to make athletes have a B grade average to play. I must say I am very pleased to hear that. Most athletes are more worried about the next game or when practice is, and they are not focused on there school work. I am all for this change. Most teenagers don't realize how important school is They need to realize that most of them will not play professionally and should focus on their school work to insure they get a good job and have a nice life. Most athletes think that they are good enough to make it to the professional level, but most have other things happen. Middle school athletes should focus more on school work and not worry about sports so much. Now I think that doing sports and after school programs is fun and I encourage it, but if it gets to the point to were they are fighting teachers to not give them homework because of the big game or the rehearsal then that has taken it to far and they should start focusing more on school work. School work should be done first and foremost. There should be an athlete or actor or whatever they do participating with a D or C average the should be in a classroom doing extra credit work. Personally, most of the blame can fall on the coaches or leaders of a group. Students should be able to do their homework right after school and not have to go straight to practice. Why is there practice right after school most parents don't let there child do anything until their homework is done. Another option, there could also be a study hall for the students that have lower then a B grade average to work on there school work when they should be practicing.",
    "No means no. It is the universal term that everyone and anyone can understand by a shake of the head. Why would a principle, who is suppose to support and help their students grow, force them into something they might not want to do. This should be a voluntary act. Some students might be uncomfortable with what the principle is asking them to do. They may not be athletic or the leader type to be in a school council or run in a student election such as a student president. Their families may not be open to the idea because of something going on at home like money, family problems, religion, etc. Or this student just may not like the idea because they may like to keep to themselves. To others it can be hard to put yourself out there in a environment you know nothing about. Parents might even have a problem with sending their child into a sport, when they fear of them getting hurt or trying to force them into something the student who just simply is not into. I remember going to my first soccer camp, it was only\u00a0one day, but I was a very shy girl who was abnormally tall for a five year old and I didnt want to talk or play soccer in front\u00a0of everyone because I was scared to feel embarrassed, I was still brand new to the sport so in the end I just stood there like a statue. I remembered that feeling and it was not a good one at all. Why should a multiple kids go through the same feeling if they really don't feel comfortable? This really should be something the students get to decide. They need to be confident and comfortable in anything the students do in school, at home, outside of school, or wherever! If they are forced into it, they may become seriously upset. They may start to get bad grades until they fail. They may loose close friends and connections with their teachers. The school should really consider these options when thinking of the students. Think of their families . They may have other plans in their minds about where their child might want to go in the future and if they are doing something else that the school has brought upon the student, then the kids family\u00a0just isnt happy with the school either. it truly is never okay to force anyone into anything. Including if it was for school, unless truly needed academically, but this time its not. This should be chosen by the student and the parents if they are willing to investing time, money, and effort into this. And if their kid said no, he or she means no and thats the end of it.\u00a0 ",
    "If it is not broken why should we fix it? The electoral college system has been with us for as long as we have had presidents and one flaw if going to make us scrap eveything? There are many ways to fix the electoral college and throwing the system in the trash should be the last resort. Although the election of 2000 is an example of a problem that shoud be fixed it is not a reason to do away with the system. \n To commence with, the electoral college is a fine system that has easily fixed flaws such as the election of George W. Bush versus Al Gore in which Gore won the popular vote while still losing the whole election. An obvious solution to this problem could be what Nebraska and Maine are doing and introducing proportional representation as opposed to the \"winner-take-all\" system. Also if we were to switch from the electoral college it would take citizens time to get used to the new stystem. Although the electoral college seems unreliable there is a certainty of outcome to it while some people dispute over the outcome of the vote it is likely an arguement about the popular vote. Although we have had the system for so long and it has been reliable and there are ways to fix it some people would still like to move away from it and create a new system. If we were to shift from the electoral college to another way to vote what would we have, a voting system fully based on popular votes? no, because a popular vote system would rely too much on citizens being able to make informed decisions which would result in unreliable outcomes. Henceforth, the electoral college is a reliable system with easily fixed flaws, therefore we should not fix or replace the system. If the electoral college was to be replaced there would be pandemonium as to what system shall replace it, how we will adapt to the new system, and if the system is an improvement or a step back in innovation and our future leaders.

    "Extracurricular activities are great ways to learn and develop skills. When you take one, you might think \"Hey, these are so great! Everyone should take one!\" But that really isn't the case for everyone. Most people have differing time schedules from one another, Some people have to cook dinner for their families or do a wide variety of chores once they get home, or they have plans with their family and friends. to make them take a extracurricular activity may push their chores and/ or responsibilities further into the night. Homework, middleschoolers and highschoolers are smothered with it every day, every week, every year. Homework, depending on your academic intelligence, may take a while, it may make them stay up late on a school day . Students usually stay up late at night doing homework, and making them do a extracurricular activity during the school year may make them stay up later due to not having that time after they leave school to do their homework, they may end up being more fatigued, they may not turn in their homework, and they may not be able to do their share of the project making people look badly upon them and making their grades suffer, When you have to stay up late at night, you usually are more tired, less aware, and your grades may drop.\nWhen you are smothered with homework, you usually stay up at night, sluggishly going through the homework so you can finally go to sleep, in FCPS, at the beginning of the year, the teachers reported that homework usually takes 2 to 4 hours. The students go home at 2:22, but they usually get home by 2:50, or 3 during unlucky circumstances. What if we added about 2 hours to that? they get home by 4 in the afternoon, they now have to do their homework. That may take them about 3 and a half hours and by now, its 7:30, the plans they had, down the drain, now they have eat dinner and go to bed because they have to wake up at 5 or 6 in the morning to catch a bus that comes at 6:30. Their weekdays just practically consist of school and homework. they will get not free time\u00a0until the weekend, and that isn't guaranteed because some teachers will assign homework during the weekends! According to a study, when students have no free time and their time just consists of homework, that will lead up to more stress, and stress leads up to anxiety, and anxiety leads up to depression.\n \nIf anything, we should make extracurricular activities optional \"Do they have the time?\"\n\"Will they be able to keep up?\" \"Will they be able to do this without getting too stressed out?\" \"Do they have too much homework?\" . Extracurricular activities should be optional because students should choose what they want to do or they don't want to do, they are freethinking.\u00a0",

See the thing is Senator the Electoral College seems like a biais to me, its unfair to the people. Many Americans dont vote because they fair that that votes won't go to the right person because in truth and in facts when the American people vote they're not voting for who's to become president they vote for the electors and not knowing that the electors dont always vote for the same person the voted for so all Americans are doing is meaningless voting because they dont really have a choice they may think they voting for Obama and the electors voted for Romney. And thats why most Americans dont vote. I feel it wouuld be best if all voting is done by popular vote , because either way all of the American people dont get a say in the voting rules but at least they know that there not being cheated. Because when they vote by electoral college most states dont even get the chance to vote because its small or under populated , which is unfair not because you know a state is small and it might not make a difference doesn't means they dont have the right to vote its totally unfair. \u00a0 ",
    "Throught the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. The developement for these cars would not be such a great idea to make . Producing vehicles with such improvements can cause many bad problems to surface in court and society as a whole. The reasoning behind these improvements being negative is safety of people. Peoole should to look at the things that might go wrong before they support something that sounds good Technology is a major factor in todays society and we use it everyday in life, but if the technology we have sold to us has issues then it should not be sold to the people until the issue is completely resolved If the driverless cars are manufactured and sold to people and there is a problem within the cars which causes them to make mistakes and have technical issues. The manufacturers are not just putting the people riding the car at risk, they are putting the lives innocent pedestrians at risk also. There is a point made in the article where it states, \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or manufacture?\". The point being made from this specific sentence is that if the cars are opperating by themselves and if something happens to anyone the only person to blame is the creator of the vehicle, the manufacturer. In most states it is illegal to test computer driven cars because of the dangers that are most likely to occur. In the article we are introduce to a statement which says,\"Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human in control at all times\". This statement is saying that if a human has control then everything should be fine. These are overall reasonings and explinations for why driverless cars should not be manufactured. Manufacturing driverless cars would not be a great idea to make for peoples overall safety. The cars would be unsafe to people as a whole and cause major issues in court as for lawsuits. As of making new and better improvements to vehicles would be a good idea. People should just stick to driving themselves places its the safest way to get there.",
    "I am righting to you today about about a very important topic, I am here to tell you that I believe we should change from Electoral College to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. First reason, why we should change to election by popular vote is because Electoral College is very unfair to the the people running for presdient, and the people voting. Its unfair mostley because of the winner-take-all system in each state. This system is ridicolus because a lot of candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states. I know a lot of crazy systems like this are making people not want to vote anymore, which is not good. Another great reason, why we should change from the Electoral College to election by popular vote is because of how out of date and irrational the Electoral College actually is. Us the people of the United States don't even get to vote for our next president directly, you help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\n The last reason, why we should change over to election by popular vote is because of the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. The way the Electoral College handles ties is unprofessional to many, becasue all they do is throw the election to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Me and many others would really enjoy if the Electoral College was changed to election by popular vote. The reason being is because of how the Electoral College is unfair and irrational.",

The big states (large population count)of the United States will have an overruling vote against smaller states(lower count of population) some states big state will convince other states to get one of their senators to party up the disputes that will occure of the sharing of population vote. In source 3 paragraph 4 says,\"Large states get more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does.\" This means that large states ingulf all of the attention from smaller population states. Later will be a growing concern for the Electoral College. This winner takes all voting style will effect the people of the swing state and the real verdict the people want or what s best for the state. It is impossible to get a tie in Electoral college ,so you will always find who will president. One problem would be the landslide that will occur rarely. T\nhese would be major problems that will occur and it will be delt with of the populariity vote for presideny and how Electoral college should be kept in the United states Goverment. ",
    "I believe that community service is extremely important and that all students should be required to perform some community service. Community service helps out the community a lot, so the students will be making their homes a better place to live and learn. Another thing that community service does is that it helps build character in a child, because they are constantly helping people out and doing the right thing. Next, community service will help with your education, because kids who do community service are more likely to get into a good college. First of all, community service makes the place you live a better place, by creating a better environment to work, learn and live, as well as make everyone happier. The community benefits a lot from kids or adults actively participating in community service. Research shows, that the cleaner and more beautiful the town or city is, the happier the people are. Who is happy when they are living in a trash can? Community service helps clean up the town, by simple things like picking up trash, or larger projects like planting trees. Education also benefits from community service, because we can teach the younger generation skills they need to grow up. Also, a better looking school, would be a better place to learn, because the students will be happier and more motivated. Secondly, students and adults who perform community service build a lot of character. This is because they are constantly helping people out, and doing the right thing. This way they will feel good about themselves, and will be a better person overall. I am a boy scout, and i always participate in activities such as, help cleaning up a state park, and help cleaning up the Connecticut River. After i do these things, i feel ready good about myself because i did the right thing, and helped out our community a lot. Furthermore, scientist have shown that students who do community service have a better chance of having a happy life than people who don't, because you will always feel good about yourself and how you have helped your community. Another reason that community service is very important, is because many ivy league colleges, and other colleges in general, are always looking for people who regularly participate in community service and also volunteer. I personally knew a person, who didn't have all A's in school, and didn't get a great score on the SAT's, but she was an volunteer at a hospital and part of a organization that helps homeless people. She got accepted into Harvard University because she did all that community service. Community service helps out a lot in our lives, by both building character and also it helps tremendously in applying for college. In addition, it also helps a lot with our education, because last year we won our regional science bowl, because some high school students decided to help out our them and come to our practices to teach us. This was very helpful for us and we benefited a lot because of that. They probably also felt better about themselves that they were teaching the younger generation and helping us out. People don't know how much you can learn from kids older than you. you can probably learn more from them than teachers, because you look up to them and respect them the same or maybe more than your teachers. So community service is extremely in education. In conclusion, I believe that community service helps out a lot with our growth and development,\neither by education, or building character. Both of those are super important in our life. Studies show that people who do community service are 3 times more likely to succeed than people who don't. And the community benefits from these acts too, because you are making your town a happier and better place to live.",
    "Some people may think that the Face on Mars was made by aliens Today I am here to share with you that scientificly it is just a natural landform. It is just a conspericy that the Face was made by aliens. The Mars Global Surveyor captured photos of what the Face looks like from above Mars. The image shows a landform on the planet that seems to look very much like a face. The Face on Mars is scientificly known to be a landform in the planet. This landform is much like the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. The landform just so happens to look like a face. That's why many people believe that the lanform is was actually made by aliens. Do you know how there are craters on the moon? If so the \"Face\" is almost like that but instead of the crater going in, it's pushing outward. That is the easiest way to describe it. So far NASA has not found aliens to be real. That doesn't meant that they aren't real. It just means that the face is highly unlikely to be made by aliens. But one day if NASA does discover aliens that might be a possibility that the \"landform\" was made by aliens. But until that day comes around it will just be considered a landform based on scientific facts. The first spacecraft to see this landform was NASA's Viking 1 in 1976. Then 18 years later, on April 5, 1998, the MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time. The picture that the MOC was 10 times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. This became very popular at that time in the past. The Face was used in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. These things started all the talk about the face being created by aliens. So in all the Face was not made by aliens at all. It just happens to be a natural landform in the shape of a face. I can see where everyone got mistaken but the facts are that it was not made by aliens. So now you will be able to say that you know a lot of things about the Face on Mars! That is everything that I can explain to you about the Face on Mars. ",
    "I think that the newly proposed rule may have advantages and disadvantages.\n It will ensure that only those who are willing to do the work and try hard will appear on the sports teams and academic groups, bettering the program. Yet I also feel that this pushes the boundaries of the 'no pass no play' rule very far. I think that students should have a choice in this yet I can't help thinking that this would help solve problems, so i am forced to vote for this new rule. those who aren't willing to do the work in order to compete obviously don't care much or they would aim for that higher grade and try harder. This will teach them a valuable lesson in life. Think, what would happen in your life as an adult if your boss told you that he needed you to do something he needed done. Many would say yes in order to please their boss. those who are not willing to work hard to do what even extra activities would probably not be willing to put out the effort for a job. what happens then? You are fired! This would show them to put more effort in order to succeed. the newly proposed rule is a wonderful idea, and will eventually provide the educational system with a higher amount of success in individual schools. i believe this could be a quite useful rule and cast my vote for the rule of no students participating in extra activities without an average of 79 or above.\n",
    "The use of technology to read students' emotions and expressions would not be valuable in a classroom. As a student living in a generation that is becoming dependent on technology, the ability for computers to read our emotions would not only be a waste of our resources but also a detriment to our education systems. There are many consequences of using technology to read our facial expressions at school. Distractions are prevalent in a classroom and adding the emotional recognition would only be adding a game for students to play with while the lesson was being taught. According to the article if the student was paying attention, their lesson could be modified based on their facial expression. This may confuse the child or present them with material in a way that has never been taught before. They then would have different information from their peers and teacher. Not only would the customized lesson confuse the student, but it would also promote the selfish lifestyle that other technology is by giving the student exactly what they want when they want it. Our students are growing up in a world where technology is providing them with everything they want, and that has made them needy, spoiled, and reliant. If the emotional recognition technology were implemented, then in the future the child may not be able to sit through a job interview or meeting because it would not be modified for their enjoyment. If we were to use technology that reads expressions, we would continue to create people who are not satisfied until everything is catered exactly they way they would like it. The use of technology to read humans' expressions would not be beneficial in a classroom. ",
    "In today's world, we are able to say a generous amount of people are being educated around the world everyday thanks to all the technology advances and the develoment of more educated minds lately. Even though not all education systems are optimal, it is believed that education can change anyone's perspective and understanding of the world. Some schools in America have decided to take advantage of the tools we have today to give students the posibility of taking a class on a device with interactive videos and activities. There is people who disagree with this new way of giving education to students I argue that the advantages and benefits of taking a class online outweight by far the cons because it can help those who are unable to attend regularly because of a condition or sickness the comfort of home, or other safe environment can improve the overall performance and those wanting to learn more can really take this as an advantage. As of myself, I am a current student in Generic_City in a public high school called Generic_School which offers these courses online to students at no cost during the school year and over the summer with a fee. A few years ago, during my freshmen year, there was a terrible car accident relating to a senior student back then; he ended up in the hospital for more than six months. This was very devastating for the family, friends and especially to his future because he was a football player and had a schoolarship waiting for him. However, his friends at school decided to help Generic_Name's parents by selling wristsbands and shirts with his favorite color, purple, to alleviate the hospital debt. When he was able to move again, one of the first thing he had in his priority list, besides recovery, was to start his learning as soon as possible so he contacted the school's principal to see if he could take advantage of our online classes so he could catch up on what he had missed in school With a little adjusting and permission with the county, he was able to continue with is education and he was able to eventually graduate from high school and I think this is a fantastic example to show one of the biggest advantages of onlne teaching. I have mentioned before, I am taking an online class. I decided to take this class for the following reasons: to experience online school and see if it was adequate for me and to get this class done this year so I could focus on more specific subjects my senior year in high school. I started the course through a platform called vision used by Generic_School, which is both an in-school class resource and a online class tool. As far as I have been experiencing this new learning format, I have found many advantages to it. The course i'm enrolled in is self-paced, meaning I can do my work when suggested or work ahead if I have the time, which I have had. This doesn't happen often to me because I always find myself stressed during school hours, not thinking of learning and working ahead, but thinking about the time I can get our of the school's campus and go home. This is something thousands of students in this school had felt or are feeling. I have made a research paper describing how decoration and lighting in a classroom affect significantly the learning process of anyone at any given time. This occurs because many schools, including mine, have pure white lights and walls which can induce anxiety, stress and overtime help mental health problems appear or worsen depending on the person This prison-like design of most classrooms and the lack of natural light really affect my focus and performance in class. However, when I find myslef in the public library or at home I can focus for longer periods of time and get my work done fater and I actually understand what I'm reading and doing better. One might believe that when students aren't in a classroom environment, they are simply just going to find a way to cheat the system and not actually do the work and tests assigned to them like a famous Youtube creator has told his fans Mark, or as most people know him Markiplier, is a famous Youtuber who has over 10 million subscribers and specializes in gameplays and some acting skits. He has shared his story multiple times about how he almost graduated from his engeinering career in college based on a complex but effective way of cheating the university's online grading system, which brings up the example of the potential abuse of online lessons I agree there is those who choose to do the wrong thing and try to cheat the system, but I have known many dedicated people who have taken online courses who always try to use the resources given to them to make the most out of their education. This can be compared to a well known classic\nMatilda, a movie about a little girl who has very high cognitive abilities, making her a child genius. She takes the public library as one of her primary resources for learning to read more books than any child of her age; however, Matilda was born into a family where intelligence and manners were not appreciated at all so she was shut down from her true mental capacities. If a child like her had these many resources, including an online system for lessons, she would've gone further with her learning in less time. She could have also done many courses herself to not be pushed aside by her family and made fun of for her desire to learn. If we look back when children were working on farms and factories, we can see how much progress out society has made in the last couple decades since we open education to more and more people ever since. It is without a doubt we're lucky for this. This is why many see online classes as a good resource since it can help those who are in a hospital to keep up with their learning, the different envirnoments surrounding a student can make a difference and it can be a tool for students who want to achieve more than average.

    "The voters of America do not vote for a president; they vote for a slate of electors who then elect a president. The Electoral College is the process of voters relying on a slate of electors to vote for the pesidential candidate of their choice, though they cannot always guarantee who the electors will vote for. The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote for the president it is a non-democratic method since voters do not get to vote for a president diectly, even though the outcome is almost always in the favor of the voter. The Electoral College is a non-democratic method of voting because voters only get to vote for a slate of electors, not the president of their choice. Although it is rare for an elector to vote for the president that is not the first choice of of the people who elected him, it has happened. The Electoral College is also unfair because in the system, the \"winner takes all\". This is unfair because nominees only spend their time campaigning in the \"swing states\" that will get them the most votes. In these states, some voters know they have no chance of getting the president they wish to elect if the majority of the state chooses to elect the other candidate. The Electoral College is an unfair way of voting because citizens do not have a voice in their elcetion; can only hope that their elector votes for the president of their chioce. Our Senator should change to election by popular vote so that every citizen may have a vote! ",
    "I'm sure most students would agree that teachers really know how to put you to work, while that sounds like a bad thing, it's actually very helpful. Teachers know how to drill information into a student's brain. However, I do understand why students would want to be in charge of organizing summer projects. Students want projects to be fun and easy, usually with as little work as possible, as to where teachers would more than likely want as much work as possible Sure it can be difficult but, there are many reasons why teacher-designed summer projects would work better. Because teachers are more experienced with designing summer projects, they know what is needed to help students construct a great project. Teachers can also assist in giving pointers to how students can be more engaged with their projects. As difficult as it might seem, the challenges that teachers set for students, actually help benefit in teaching students the material. \n Teachers have organized many summer projects throughout their years of teaching. They are more qualified to organize them because, they know what material students struggle with and they know how to make the information stick. Teachers have lots of experience with helping students create summer projects, therefore, should be the people who organize them. While the work may seem tedious and difficult at times, teachers are simply just trying to assist in helping you gain the knowledge and understand it. By giving students a lot of work, teachers are helping them learn not only the information being attained from the project but also, how to manage their time efficiently. Teachers understand that when students are working in a time frame, they have a better understanding of how to manage their time to work efficiently and get everything done before the due date. Experienced teachers can guide students in how to manage their time, get everything done, and still have time to spare. It is because of experienced teachers that students have been able to construct outstanding summer projects. If a student is engaged, they are more likely to succeed. Teachers engage students by designing summer projects in a way that interests them. A student who is engaged in their project is more likely to receive a good grade than a student who showed no interest in it at all. Teachers typically try to stick to things that inspire all students equally, they try not to lean towards a specific influence as to remain unbiased. Students have many different interests which is why student-organized projects would be beneficial. A teacher with a good understanding of their student's likes and dislikes can better organize a project that will help students be engaged. Keeping students engaged is a difficult, but manageable, task and while not every teacher can do it, they all try. Challenges can motivate students into working their hardest and trying their best. While some may argue that challenging work actually causes students to be less inclined to do summer projects, it actually motivates them more. Statistics show that students who are challenged receive better grades than those who are not. If students were to organize a summer project, they would more than likely leave out any form of a challenge, students would much rather have free time than work on a summer project and that would lead to students designing an easy summer project that requires little effort. Teachers on the other hand, give students lots of work so they can gain the information in a much better way. Summer projects aren't made to take up all your free time, they are made to make sure the information that was being taught during school actually stuck and that students fully understand it. Teachers who challenge their students are the teachers with the highest passing scores. \n Teachers can organize a summer project better than students because they are highly experienced in doing so. Teachers find ways to engage and challenge their students which leads to a higher passing rate. So while student-designed projects can be fun and easy, it's more effective when summer projects are teacher-designed. The biggest problem with teacher-designed projects is that not every teacher or student is the same, However teacher-designed projects are said to be more successful than student-designed projects. They are not always fun, but they are always effective. Teachers are always working to help students gain information and be successful in life. So next time you have a summer project and you want it to be student-designed, think about all the things your teachers do to make sure you are going to be successful. It isn't supposed to be easy, and it isn't always going to be fun, but as long as you learn the information, it will always be beneficial. ",
    "Have you ever been faced with a boring computer assignment? Maybe you have dreaded coming to school or finishing your homework? As technology is advancing and more of the classroom is found through an electronic device, some students may find themselves losing interest in their daily lessons. What if this could be changed by a system that takes your facial expressions into account and accomodates to your mood? Right when the assignment has begun to lose your interest, this system could sense the change and alter the lesson plan to regain your interest. The Facial Action Coding System may be valuable and allow for improvement to be made within classrooms and within students. \n Initially, as technology is advancing daily and students find themselves online more often, this system could improve their lessons. Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, \"most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication\" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states \"if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow\" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student. By the same token, using this sort of technology in the classroom will keep a student engaged during their lessons When Dr. Huang describes how this system can engage a student he states, \"[the computer] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" and further explains that \"[the system] could modify the lesson\" to acomidate to the students needs (para. 6). In a normal classroom, when the teachers method of teaching is confusing students, the teacher should find a different way of teaching to engage students. The author also explains how the system is able to read six different emotions and can \"identify mixed emotions\" to allow the system to see if their methods are benefitting the student (para. 4). This computer system would be valuable when keeping the students engaged. Finally, this system may change the ways in which many students view school It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a \"fake smile\" and that to them \"faces don't lie\" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that \"moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them\" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things. Consequently, this system would be valuable to classrooms and would allow for improvement to be made within schools and the students. Overall, it is evident that computers are unable to read emotions and reciprocate to the individual adequately. This system might prove to reengage students in their learning, and improve their moods altogether. ",
    "You should join the Seagoing Cowboy and UNRRA program you get to see many unique places. you get to help people by getting them food and helping them stay alive you get to help hungry soldiers thatare helping our country.

You could also see some amazing animals along the way.\nLuke liked Greece and the other places so much is in Greece he liked Acropolis. He liked the other places but Greece was his favorite. He also went on nine trips! The most of any Seagoing Cowboys. He also had to clean the stalls of the lower levels of the ship sometimes. One day he had to stop working for a couple of days because of cracked ribs because of flying overboard. The best part of being a Seagoing Cowboy is having fun. The cowboys played baseball,volleyball,and table-tennis and alot of other things too but Luke really loved being a Seagoing Cowboy. ",
    "I agree with having extracurricular activities, they can also help you so much as life grows. Extracurricular activities can help you get more knowledge about what you are doing it will help you in the long run with collage it can help people get something off their mind. if you play sports you can learn any knowledge\u00a0from hearing or even watching he T.V. screen There was this one time when I was getting ready to get on a horse and my horse trainer said \"make sure you always tighten up your girth before you get on the horse.\" Then she showed me the reason why she would always tighten her girth before she got on. extracurricular activities always help you in the long run if you want to go into collage. The people who except you in are the people who have checked your grades, sols, and even check your sport status to see if you got any scholarships. They want to make sure that you did not get in trouble a lot. Because if you did you will not go into collage.\n you can always help people who try extracurricular activities if they want to get their mind off something if they have a hard life or just want to do something fun. Sometimes when I am sad I like to see my friends and they always cheer me up.\n \nI think doing extracurricular activities is a 100% recomended if anyone wants to try it. Extracurricular activities can help you get more knowledge about what you are doing, it will help you in the long run with collage, and it can help people get something off their mind.\u00a0"
